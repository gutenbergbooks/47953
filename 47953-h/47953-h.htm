<h2 class="main">PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Most of this volume is occupied with accounts of
the Dominican and Augustinian missions in the islands during the period
1641&ndash;70; they are enabled to maintain fairly flourishing
activities by the aid of new re&euml;nforcements. These chronicles also
contain, as usual, much interesting secular information; the most
important occurrences in the secular affairs of the islands are the
rise and fall of Governor Fajardo&rsquo;s favorite Venegas, and the
arrest of Governor Diego Salcedo by the Inquisition (at the instance of
Auditor Bonifaz, who then usurps the government). The latter incident
is related in detail by a Spanish officer imprisoned by the
usurper.</p>
<p class="par">A document of especial human interest is a letter
(January 15, 1669) written from the dungeons of Fort Santiago in
Manila, by an unnamed officer imprisoned therein by the usurping
auditor Bonifaz. He relates in full the arrest (1668) of Governor Diego
de Salcedo by the commissary of the Inquisition, the usurpation of the
government of the islands by Bonifaz, and the imprisonment of himself
and other loyalists on suspicion of attempting to rescue the governor
from durance. The attitude of the writer is unusual, for at the outset
he announces his gratitude and loyalty to his patron, Salcedo&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>predecessor, Manrique de Lara, then under
charges&mdash;from which he was later acquitted&mdash;in his
residencia; and he speaks of Salcedo without any blame or resentment,
although the governor had deprived him of his military command. This
document is freely annotated from another contemporary account, long
and diffuse; the two cast much light on political and religious affairs
in Manila at the time, especially on the possibilities for evil
embodied in the Inquisition.</p>
<p class="par">Extracts from Santa Cruz&rsquo;s <i lang=
"es">Historia</i> (Zarago&ccedil;a, 1693) cover the history of the
Dominican order in the Philippines for 1641&ndash;69. Fray Francisco de
Paula is elected provincial in 1641, at which time the order has barely
enough religious to fill its actual ministries&mdash;a lack which is
afterward supplied as an answer to prayer. The location of the
Pari&aacute;n is changed, in 1640; and the entire quarter is destroyed
by fire, two years later. In 1644 Diego de Fajardo comes to the islands
as governor&mdash;under whom they &ldquo;tasted all sorts of
government.&rdquo; The chief events of his term of office are
recounted, and the more important transactions of the Dominican
chapter-sessions of 1647 and 1650. In the former year dies the aged
provincial, Fray Domingo Gon&ccedil;alez; he is succeeded by Fray
Carlos Gant. In 1648 a patache reaches the islands in safety, although
it has to be burned, immediately after unlading, to save it from the
Dutch; but those enemies thereupon leave the islands, which they have
not since infested. This vessel also brings a re&euml;nforcement of
thirty Dominican religious, which greatly encourages the missionaries;
and various ecclesiastical favors and concessions. Santa Cruz recounts
the more important <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11"
name="pb11">11</a>]</span>acts of the provincial chapter-session of
1650, and furnishes biographical sketches of many Dominican
missionaries in the islands. He then proceeds to relate the arrest and
death of Fajardo&rsquo;s quondam favorite Venegas.</p>
<p class="par">In 1652 Fray Pedro de Ledo becomes provincial; at this
same chapter-session is formally announced the erection of Santo
Tom&aacute;s college into a university; and the mission of Ituy is more
fully organized. The savage mountaineers of that region are well
described by our author; their conversion is a difficult matter. In
1653 distinguished personages arrive at Manila, including Governor
Manrique de Lara and Archbishop Poblete. The Dominican chapter enact
that every lecturer in their university must know at least one of the
native languages. In 1654 attempt is made, but fruitlessly, to send a
mission to Japan; finally, five missionaries succeed in reaching China,
where they labor zealously to convert the heathen. The provincial
chosen in 1656 is Fray Jacinto Gali, but he dies soon afterward, while
visiting Cagay&aacute;n; his place is taken by Fray Lucas Montanero. On
August 20, 1658, occurs an earthquake, itself more severe than that of
1645, but its succeeding shocks being lighter. The Dominican convent is
badly injured, and the friars with difficulty find lodgings. A large
re&euml;nforcement of missionaries arrives in this same year. At the
chapter-session of 1659, the Dominicans refuse to permit their
missionaries in China to accept offering of lands, fearing that the
Chinese may regard them as actuated by selfish motives. At that of
1661, Fray Felipe Pardo (afterward famous as commissary of the
Inquisition and as archbishop of Manila) is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>elected
provincial. Two years later, arrangements are made for printing a
ritual for use by the missionaries of the order. In the same year
(1663) Salcedo arrives at Manila as governor; his career is briefly
reviewed. The provincial elected in 1665 is Fray Juan de los Angeles;
and in the following year thirty-nine more Dominicans join their
brethren in Filipinas. The ship which brings them is detained by bad
weather on the coast of S&aacute;mar, where a Jesuit missionary shows
them all most generous hospitality, refusing any compensation. A letter
from the head of the Dominican order to Morales is reproduced. In 1667
Archbishop Poblete dies at Manila, after fourteen years&rsquo; service.
In that year the intermediary chapter-session is held, at which
measures are taken to restrain the members of the order from
unauthorized interference with, or censure of, the civil government.
Two more Dominicans arrive from Mexico in 1668, and the remarkable
escape of one of them, with several other Spaniards, from death by
shipwreck is related. Several friars proceed, amid great difficulties,
to the Chinese missions. The Dominicans are laboring among the
Zambales, many of whom become Christians and settle in mission
villages; and they hope that they may soon do the same for the heathen
Irrayas.</p>
<p class="par">An account of the Augustinian friars in the Philippines
for 1641&ndash;70 is furnished by Casimiro Diaz in his <i lang=
"es">Conquistas</i>. At the chapter-session of 1641, Fray
Ger&oacute;nimo de Medrano is elected provincial. Soon afterward,
Archbishop Guerrero dies; a sketch of his life and character is
presented by Diaz. Three years later, Medrano is succeeded by
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>Fray Alonso Carvajal; and Diego Fajardo comes as
governor of the islands, his personal and official character being
outlined by our writer. The threats of the Dutch, and their conquest of
Hermosa, fill the Spaniards with great anxiety. Unfortunately, Fajardo
is dominated by the influence of a favorite, Venegas, to which very ill
results are attributed. The peace made with the Moros is only
temporary; for when they see the Spaniards so harried by the Dutch they
again infest the Visayas. The Acapulco galleons arrive safely, although
the Dutch ships lie in wait for them. One of them carries the new
archbishop of Manila, who dies just before reaching the islands. In
1647 the Augustinians choose Fray Diego de Ord&aacute;s as their
provincial. Soon afterward, they decide to establish in Mexico a
hospice for their religious who must halt there on their journey from
Spain to the Philippines. In this same year the Dutch finally cease to
molest those islands; and in Jolo they are, although favored by the
natives, unable to dislodge the Spaniards. They are also foiled in an
attack on Zamboanga. An Augustinian friar is killed by the Negritos, of
which people Diaz gives an interesting description; this murder is
afterward avenged by Heaven, all concerned in it becoming lepers. Diaz
mentions in forcible terms the unhappiness, suffering, and terror
caused in Manila by the harsh measures of Fajardo&rsquo;s favorite.
Another great misfortune is the loss of the galleon
&ldquo;Encarnaci&oacute;n,&rdquo; which brings ruin to many citizens of
Manila.</p>
<p class="par">In 1650, Medrano is elected provincial of his order for
the third time. With much difficulty, the Augustinians finally succeed
in despatching a procurator to Spain to obtain a re&euml;nforcement of
missionaries. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>Diaz relates the events of 1651&ndash;52, mainly
including the harsh and illegal acts of Fajardo&rsquo;s favorite,
Venegas, and the latter&rsquo;s downfall&mdash;this being brought about
by the courage of the Augustinian provincial Medrano, who makes
complaint of Venegas to the governor. In 1653, Fray Andr&eacute;s de
Verdugo is elected provincial; and the new governor, Manrique de Lara,
arrives, with Archbishop Poblete, and bishops for all the three
suffragan sees. Fajardo is sent to Spain, but dies on the voyage; his
favorite Venegas dies in prison, and all his property is confiscated.
The new governor and archbishop do all in their power to remedy the sad
condition in which they find Manila. The latter, however, attempts to
enforce the right of episcopal visitation of the friars in charge of
parishes, whereupon those posts are abandoned by the religious orders.
The matter is referred to the Audiencia, who enjoin the archbishop to
suspend the visitation in such cases until the Council of the Indias
can take action on the question; that Council did not support his
claims. Diaz discusses quite fully the subject of such visitation,
largely from the practical standpoint; he argues that the system in
vogue in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a cannot be properly applied in Filipinas,
where conditions are so different. Poblete devotes his energies to
rebuilding the cathedral, which had been ruined in the earthquake of
1645; but many obstacles hinder its completion, and it is not dedicated
until 1671. In 1654 a re&euml;nforcement of Augustinian missionaries
arrives, who are greatly needed in the province. Brief notices of these
are presented; all of them are natives of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. Diaz
relates the oppression of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href=
"#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>natives in the building of ships for
Manila, which has been the cause of several past insurrections; the
loss of some galleons by shipwreck is considered by many a judgment
from Heaven on the cruelties practiced on the natives in building those
vessels. In 1656, Alonso Quijano is elected provincial; during his
term, many members of his province die, and its burdens are very heavy.
Ord&aacute;s is again elected provincial in 1659. Diaz relates the
great losses of the Philippine people during Manrique de Lara&rsquo;s
term, mainly by shipwrecks, which bury men, money, and ships.
Insurrections of the natives occur, which are quieted, but at much loss
and cost. In 1662 Fray Alonso Coronel is elected provincial; especial
attention is given by the Augustinians to their missions in northern
Luz&oacute;n. The galleon sent out that year reaches Acapulco in
safety; this gives opportunity for the new governor Salcedo and an
Augustinian mission, who have been waiting long in Mexico for a ship,
to pass over to Filipinas. A Recollect mission also arrives in the same
expedition. Compelled by storms to land on the coast of Cagay&aacute;n,
they all make their way overland to Manila, experiencing great
hardships. Diaz presents brief notices of all the new missionaries of
his order, and relates the more important events in the early years of
Salcedo&rsquo;s term of office. Dissensions arise between the two new
auditors, which later result in disaster to the whole community.
Manrique de Lara is sent back to Spain, and exonerated from the charges
made in his residencia. Salcedo accomplishes much in shipbuilding and
the extension of commerce. Fray Alonso Quijano is re&euml;lected
provincial of the Augustinians in 1665; that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>chapter
again refuses the governor&rsquo;s demand for lists of its priests who
act as curas, the Dominicans also declining to furnish such
information. In that same year the Augustinians begin a mission to the
Apayaos, in charge of the fervent Fray Benito de Mena; he succeeds
after many labors and hardships, in establishing three villages of
these converts. Salcedo determines &ldquo;to undertake some conquest
that would result to the honor of God and extend the Spanish
government;&rdquo; the council that he summons for advice on this point
agree (both military officers and superiors of religious orders) that
the most promising enterprise of this sort is the conquest of the
Igorot tribes in northern Luz&oacute;n. Diaz gives a brief sketch of
these peoples, and relates their conquest by a Spanish expedition
(1668), and the subsequent conversion of many heathen there by
Augustinian missionaries.</p>
<p class="par">Salcedo causes a galleon to be built at Albay, the
largest and best yet made in these islands. Diaz complains of the
practice of sending criminals from Mexico to Filipinas. In 1667, the
first mission to the Marianas Islands sets out; it is composed of
Jesuits, under the leadership of Sanvitores, later famous for his
martyrdom in those islands. The provincial elected by the Augustinians
in 1668 is Fray Dionisio Su&aacute;rez, characterized later by our
writer as being &ldquo;more angel than man.&rdquo; The number of
missionaries in the order is far too small for its needs (a lack shared
also by the other orders), and they are rejoiced when a
re&euml;nforcement of seventeen religious arrive in that same year at
Manila. Certain shipwrecked people from some remote and unknown island
are driven at that time <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href=
"#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>on the shores of Capul Island; and
some Spaniards are drowned while trying to cross the Embocadero.
Salcedo governs five years, incurring great enmities among prominent
persons in the community, which end in his arrest by the Inquisition,
and a harsh imprisonment until his death. Diaz, who often visited
Salcedo while in durance, gives an interesting sketch of him, and
praises his pious resignation and patience in affliction; but he
carefully refrains from further comment on the events connected with
Salcedo&rsquo;s arrest, or the persons engaged in it. Diaz mentions
very briefly the assumption of gubernatorial authority by the auditor
Bonifaz (whom he commends as discreet and disinterested), and some of
his notable acts during his brief rule. At one time, he nearly loses
his life by a musket-ball, whether fired intentionally or not is
uncertain. Salcedo is twice embarked for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, but is
driven back by storms on the first voyage, and dies while on the
second. In 1669 arrives the new governor, Don Manuel de Le&oacute;n.
His government is praised, as establishing in the islands peace and
plenty; commerce flourishes, and there are no wars or revolts. With
Le&oacute;n also arrive thirty-two new laborers for the Augustinian
missions, a welcome addition to their forces. The usurper Bonifaz takes
refuge in the Franciscan convent, where he remains until his death. The
Council of the Indias pronounces sentence against him, and renders
decision in favor of the auditor Coloma. In the spring of 1670 occurs a
religious function which had been long in disuse, the publication in
the cathedral of Manila of the edicts of the Inquisition; this is
accompanied by processions and various ceremonies. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>The
Augustinian province is enabled to conduct its labors much more
satisfactorily, and with greater results, by the aid of its new
missionaries.</p>
<p class="par">A rambling, gossipy account of Manila and the
Philippines in the middle of the seventeenth century, with much
entertaining information regarding persons and events therein, is
furnished by the Dominican friar Domingo F. Navarrete, in his <i lang=
"es">Tratados historicos</i> (Madrid, 1676); it is from relations of
this sort, and on account of these characteristics, that the student
gains additional and valuable side-lights on the history of any time or
country. The <i lang="es">Tratados</i> is mainly devoted to the empire
of China, where its author was a missionary during 1658&ndash;69; we
present here (in both translation and synopsis) such part as relates to
his stay in the Philippines (1648&ndash;53). Navarrete describes the
journey thither, in picturesque and lively fashion. Acapulco has
&ldquo;an infernal climate.&rdquo; The missionaries are obliged to make
the journey from Lampon to Manila by land, a trip full of hardship and
danger; but they are delighted with the beauty of Pasig River, adorned
with palaces, gardens, and villages. At the time, the islands are
governed by Diego Fajardo, who &ldquo;had great gifts for government,
for he had a horror of money and of women.&rdquo; Navarrete censures
Corcuera for many things, among them the impositions levied on the
natives, which he describes in full; these occasion so much oppression
and extortion that the Indians flee from the islands, or refuse to sow
their fields. He mentions various instances of this oppression. In
rambling and discursive fashion he relates the leading characteristics
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>of the natives, the occupations of the
missionaries, the changes in official circles, etc. This document will
be concluded in <span class="sc">VOL. XXXVIII</span>.</p>

<h2 class="main">EVENTS IN FILIPINAS, 1668</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first"><i>Copy of a letter written by a citizen of Manila
to another at the court in Madrid</i></p>
<p class="par">It is notorious among all the people of these islands
that Don Diego Salcedo,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e390src" href=
"#xd21e390" name="xd21e390src">1</a> as soon as he took possession of
their government, deprived me of the command that I held as
captain-general of the artillery therein&mdash;without any further
reason than that I was a follower of Don Sabiniano Manrrique de Lara,
his predecessor. The latter governed these islands with ability as his
works show&mdash;bestowing honors with liberal hand on all the citizens
of this state; and rewarding all whose standing and services deserved
it, and even many more. How little gratitude he received for these
favors may be learned from his own confession and statement. He
suffered much in the residencia which he furnished of his government;
although he deserved to leave it with <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>laurels, he experienced
intolerable severities inflicted by those whom he had most benefited.
Don Diego was not content with depriving me of my command, but desired
to inflict further injury upon me, and one which would result in more
annoyance to Don Sabiniano Manrrique de Lara&mdash;to whom I owe what I
am; and I have striven to repay, to some extent, by personal service
the much that I owed him by attending to the business matters that came
up in his residencia, and providing an outfit of stores for his voyage.
In order, therefore, to remove me from Don Sabiniano&rsquo;s side, Don
Diego commanded me to go with some infantry to protect the coast of the
province of Tayabas; he said that he had news that the armed fleets of
Borney and Mindanao were roaming about infesting the villages of the
island of Mindoro, and that they comprised 170 vessels. His object, as
above stated, was evident in the scanty equipment of men and supplies
that was furnished to me. I remained there until Don Sabiniano
entreated that I might be withdrawn [from that post], since the time of
his embarkation for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a was very near, and he desired
to settle with me some matters relating to his outfit, as his Lordship
could not do this with any one else. But my permission [to retire] came
so late that when I arrived in this city Don Sabiniano was already at
the port of Cavite to go on shipboard; and I had only five days in
which to aid his Lordship, when the ship set sail. I bring forward all
this in order to show that I am not governed by prejudice.</p>
<p class="par">Now, stating the case, I declare that on October 9 of
this present year at one o&rsquo;clock at night the palace was entered
by the father commissary of the Holy <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>Office, Fray Jose
Paternina, with the two alcaldes-in-ordinary, General Sebastian Rayo
and Don Nicolas de Pamplona, Sargento-mayor Diego de Morales, and
Captains Don Gonzalo Samaniego (a nephew of the commissary) and Don
Juan de Vargas&mdash;both citizens who hold that office in this royal
camp, each commanding a company; also Don Juan de Robles, and three or
four others. Twenty other men remained in various offices of the
palace, and eighteen or twenty friars of St. Francis all armed. These
visitors seized Don Diego immediately placing on him a pair of fetters;
he was in his shirt just as he was sleeping, and without giving him
time to put on his white drawers they thrust his Lordship into a
hammock, and carried him a prisoner to the convent of San Francisco.
There they shut him within a cell with soldiers as guards to secure his
person. The company who were on guard in the palace, on hearing the
noise, were ready to spring to their arms; but the
master-of-camp&mdash;who was Don Agustin de Zepeda, whom I have already
mentioned, went to make the guard-room safe, and gave orders that no
one should stir, because the Inquisition had been performing its
duty.</p>
<p class="par">By morning the news of this unheard-of occurrence had
spread around; and by the time the city gates were opened the people
were in amazement, which could only be understood by one who should
know by experience the greatness and power of a governor of these
islands. I was alcalde-mayor of the province of Tondo, and it gave me
no little anxiety to notice the mutterings of the Indians who seemed to
be rising out of a deep lethargy.</p>
<p class="par">[As for the question] whether the Holy Office
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name=
"pb26">26</a>]</span>could act without the co&ouml;peration of the
supreme authority here, since [the governor is] a personage who
represents in these islands the royal person, there is not a learned
person in the two religious orders of St. Dominic and the Society who
will not answer it in the negative. And as the loyal vassal has no
greater obligation than to obey the commands of his king and natural
lord, and in regard to the faith, that which is taught by our mother
the Roman Catholic Church, without [giving it] any other interpretation
than that given by the holy doctors of the Church, I know not what to
say, since I will not withdraw from this or retract one jot. The
disputes which Don Diego, when he came from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a to
govern these islands, had with the father commissary Fray Jose
Paternina over some differences and grievances were public and
notorious; and those whom the father commissary carried with him [for
this arrest] were nearly all enemies of Don Diego. It is not a rash
assumption by those who are more inclined to reflect that this affair
was thus hurried through more through passion than through virtuous
zeal. I base my opinion on the following reasons, not to mention many
others which I reserve for their proper time, as I have not leisure at
present for writing more at length&mdash;submitting myself to the
correction of the Holy Office; for I am, and am proud of being, a
Christian Catholic and a descendant of the Catholic knights.</p>
<p class="par">The first, as I said, was that the father commissary was
at outs with his Lordship on account of disputes between them during
the voyage. Moreover, the father commissary was poor and his
provincial, father Fray Alonso Quijano, had not provided him
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>with any post as prior in his order, and had not
treated the commissary as the latter wished. Then too, the governor had
given no office to Captain Don Gonzalo Samaniego, the
commissary&rsquo;s nephew&mdash;whom his uncle the commissary so
valued, and so endeavored to provide for; and, although the nephew was
appointed a captain in this royal camp, he was not captain of any
company on account of the scarcity of men, since the
re&euml;nforcements sent by the viceroy of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a to his
Lordship were very limited.</p>
<p class="par">The master-of-camp was a declared enemy, because a few
months before Don Diego had arrested him and placed him in the castle
of Santiago at the port of Cavite, and brought suit against
him&mdash;from which he afterward came out free.</p>
<p class="par">[The same is true of] General Sebastian Rayo for the
following reason: that during the five years while Don Diego was
governor Don Sebastian was twice arrested&mdash;once by order of Don
Francisco Coloma, former judge of the residencia of Don Sabiniano, on
account of matters pertaining to the said residencia; and because on
Corpus Christi day, when it was celebrated this year, he refused to
allow the captain of the guard, Don Juan de Ezquerra, to walk in the
place belonging to the alcaldes. [General Sebastian Rayo], not wishing
the captain of the guard to retire from his place accompanying the
procession, turned toward his Lordship, and in a loud voice said to the
[officials of] the city of Manila, &ldquo;Only his Majesty and those
who represent his royal person can settle this matter, and no one else
can do so with proper zeal.&rdquo; His Lordship was displeased at the
manner in which he spoke to him in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28"
href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>so public a place, while walking
in the group of the Audiencia with the honorable auditors, and regarded
his speech as disrespectful. When the procession was ended, the
governor ordered the general to be arrested and placed in the castle at
the port of Cavite, bringing suit against him. During this interval,
the said General Rayo was at the point of death; for he was in distress
from the dampness of that locality and the disease of beri-beri from
which he suffered. At his petition the governor removed the general to
the city, so that he might stay in his house as a prisoner, until the
conclusion of his suit; but the imprisonment of his Lordship occurred
before that time.</p>
<p class="par">Captain Don Nicolas de Pamplona, the second alcalde,
also bore a grudge against his Lordship&mdash;partly on account of the
said imprisonment of the master-of-camp, Don Agustin de Cepeda, his
brother-in-law; and partly because his Lordship had imprisoned him
also, because complaint had been made to his Lordship by father Fray
Pedro Bautista, former provincial of the Order of St. Francis, that the
said captain while alcalde-mayor of the province of Bulacan had levied
a repartimiento of Indians to cut timber for building his house in the
city.</p>
<p class="par">Sargento-mayor Diego de Morales was also resentful
because his Lordship sent him to the province of Cagayan for military
service, and it is not long since he was recalled thence.</p>
<p class="par">The provincial of St. Francis, Fray Francisco Solier,
was a man of very little discretion although virtuous; and the
[Franciscan] guardian, Fray Mateo de la Asuncion (who was quite
uneducated) came two years ago with a shipment of forty religious
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>of his order. The other fathers, his subordinates,
did not conceal their anger against his Lordship for having commanded
them to take out of the ship that sailed this year for Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a the custodio<a class="noteref" id="xd21e424src" href=
"#xd21e424" name="xd21e424src">2</a> whom they were sending thither;
they did not consider the grants that his Lordship had made to their
order&mdash;at one time giving them 5,000 pesos by means of which they
were able to complete their church, which had a representation of
Paradise. They talked so indiscreetly about the governor that many
persons were afraid to hear them. Similar things could be said of the
rest who were present at the seizure of his Lordship.</p>
<p class="par">Having arrested the governor, that very night the father
commissary wrote a letter to the auditors, who had met in a session of
Audiencia, informing them of the imprisonment of the governor and
demanding that they open his Majesty&rsquo;s decrees, in order to carry
out the royal will&mdash;since his Majesty commands that in an
emergency when there is lack of a governor, either through death or for
other reasonable cause, the royal Audiencia shall govern in civil
affairs, and the senior auditor in military matters. Don Francisco
Coloma undertook to assume the military government as the senior
auditor in the court; but this was opposed by Don Francisco Mansilla,
who claimed that he was the senior because he took the oath one week
before Se&ntilde;or Coloma did so. He said that although afterward he
allowed Se&ntilde;or Coloma to take precedence, it was through his fear
of the governor, Don Diego de Salcedo&mdash;because the latter came
from Espa&ntilde;a on very intimate terms <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb30" href="#pb30" name="pb30">30</a>]</span>with Se&ntilde;or Coloma,
and his Lordship desired Se&ntilde;or Coloma to take precedence and
never surrender his rank as senior.</p>
<p class="par">Se&ntilde;or Coloma alleged the fact that he was in
possession, and other arguments, and nothing was settled; and as the
desire and the ambition to command were shared alike by all, the
cunning of Don Juan Manuel de la Pe&ntilde;a Bonifaz<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e436src" href="#xd21e436" name="xd21e436src">3</a> was employed
for his appointment as judge of the controversy. This he soon obtained,
[the others] thinking that he would quickly settle the difficulty. He
said that he had no notes of the acts which had been issued regarding
this case, and, that he might come to a clearer understanding, these
should be handed over to him; and stated that in a few days he would
announce his decision regarding the difference in priority. All agreed
to this; but immediately another and more important question
arose&mdash;who was to hold the [disputed] authority in the interval
while Don Juan Manuel was deciding the question of seniority? The
latter, as one who was sagacious, finding himself now the umpire of the
dispute, told Se&ntilde;or Coloma that his position would be aided by
depositing the authority in his hands [<i>i.e.</i>, Don Juan&rsquo;s];
and he said the same to Se&ntilde;or Mansilla. As each one of the
claimants desired to propitiate Don Juan in behalf of his respective
claims, both agreed that the authority should be deposited in his
hands&mdash;not heeding the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href=
"#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>numberless difficulties that might
result from this, as was actually the case. For, finding that he
possessed the military command, he began his schemes that very
morning&mdash;paying compliments to the officers and displaying great
kindness to the soldiers, pitying them for their many privations. Then,
taking the money of Governor Don Diego de Salcedo which had been
seized,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e444src" href="#xd21e444" name=
"xd21e444src">4</a> on that very day, the night after Don Diego&rsquo;s
arrest, Don Juan ordered the signal to be given for calling the
soldiers together, and paid the infantry their arrears of wages. All,
delighted with the money then received and the greater amounts that
they expected afterward, rendered thanks to the possessor, or rather
usurper of the new post of command; for it has ever been that novelty
is applauded by the common crowd.</p>
<p class="par">The two claimants continued their efforts to assert
their rights; but, without hearing them or waiting <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>for
anything more, the new commander issued an act after consulting two
advocates, the licentiates Don Eugenio Gutierrez de Mendoza and Don
Juan de Rosales,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e457src" href="#xd21e457"
name="xd21e457src">5</a> without consulting or even noticing the fiscal
of his Majesty, whom by right this matter concerned&mdash;for as the
parties had a year or two before referred the decision regarding this
seniority to the royal Council, his Majesty [alone] could not settle
this point; and accordingly until the royal and supreme Council should
render their decision, the [disputed] authority must remain <i>ad
interim</i> in his gift. Don Juan ordered Tomas de Palenzuela y
Zurbaran, a notary-public and his confidant, to proceed to notify the
parties and the fiscal. Se&ntilde;or Coloma, for reasons and motives of
his own, consented to the act; Se&ntilde;or Mansilla replied that he
had arguments to bring forward, and the same reply was given on the
part of the treasury.</p>
<p class="par">During this interval the self-appointed governor made
every effort to transfer his sway to the palace; and by the advice and
opinion on this damnable intention given by his two
confidants&mdash;Don Francisco de Figueroa, a crafty man of a perverse
disposition; in conjunction with the turbulent nature of his second
confidant, the notary Zurbaran&mdash;he, chosen by himself, commanded
the companies of the soldiery to march, and with a squadron of horse
took possession [of the palace]. The people were amazed, not knowing
what to do at sight of so monstrous an act; and he who was most
ambitious was most silent at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href=
"#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>seeing the new and hasty introduction
of the auditor Don Juan Manuel [into the government]&mdash;astonished
that this man (although he was the most recent of the auditors, and his
Majesty commands that in case of the governor&rsquo;s death or other
emergency, the senior auditor should direct military affairs), although
excluded by the said decree, could usurp the government by the power
which he had in a few hours obtained. From that time the minds of some
persons were continually inflamed with anger, although it was
dissimulated on account of the distrust which very properly prevailed
toward him; but I will leave this for a later account.</p>
<p class="par">Don Juan Manuel continued his rule apparently in peace,
although many persons were greatly irritated at his conduct; but, as
conscience pricked him, he lived in fear and with more anxiety than was
necessary, for the companies of soldiers were all stationed near the
palace where he now lived as the superior who had gained entrance
therein.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e469src" href="#xd21e469" name=
"xd21e469src">6</a></p>
<p class="par">A very few days later, the gentlemen of the royal
Audiencia with the fiscal of his Majesty went at day-break to take
refuge in the house of the Society of Jesus in this city&mdash;availing
themselves of the sacred house for the greater peace and quiet of the
community. There, seating themselves in a suitable apartment, they held
a session [of the Audiencia]; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href=
"#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>and for this purpose had made
arrangements to carry with them the small seal which the chancellor,
Don Tomas de Castro, had procured. From that place the Audiencia
summoned the city [council], who immediately went thither in obedience
to this call&mdash;the two alcaldes and the regidors&mdash;as also did
the sargento-mayor and master-of-camp of the garrison. This being
learned by the usurper&mdash;because not all went, as would doubtless
happen&mdash;he immediately commanded that the soldiers be assembled;
and he issued a proclamation that all under penalty of death and being
considered traitors to his Majesty, should resort to the palace where
he was, and not to the house of the Society of Jesus where the auditors
were. This was promptly obeyed, because Don Juan was found to be the
commander of the troops. Herein the people did not sin through evil
intentions, for they are very loyal to his Majesty, but through
ignorance, not knowing whom they ought to obey, or what was most to his
Majesty&rsquo;s service; and as they heard proclamations summoning them
all to the palace, under penalty of incurring treason to the king, they
quickly obeyed.</p>
<p class="par">The usurper being hindered by warlike preparations, the
gentlemen [of the Audiencia] occupied themselves in issuing orders
addressed to all persons of high standing and to the military
officers,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e478src" href="#xd21e478" name=
"xd21e478src">7</a> that they should immediately, under penalty of
being considered traitors to his Majesty, proceed to the house of the
Society of Jesus. When the usurper <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35"
href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>learned this, he forestalled
their intentions by sending a large body of infantry, who completely
surrounded the college on the outside&mdash;with the strictest orders
that they should not allow any person to enter it of any class
whatever, nor would he even allow their ordinary provisions to be
carried in&mdash;using sophistical arguments to assure the common
people that no one was required by obedience to go there, for the
meeting of the auditors was of no account since they did not hold it in
the accustomed place and hall.</p>
<p class="par">In order to prevent disturbances, the auditors desiring
peace and general tranquillity issued a royal decree in order that the
usurper might become obedient [to their authority]. Therein they stated
that as Don Francisco de Montemayor y Mansilla had surrendered the
right of seniority that he claimed, the authority of captain-general
had in the name of his Majesty been handed over, and its possession
given to Don Francisco Coloma for the government of military affairs,
in fulfilment of the royal will.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e485src"
href="#xd21e485" name="xd21e485src">8</a> The delivery of this royal
decree into the hands of the usurper was entrusted to the zeal of the
Society of Jesus, which always has been steadfast in the royal service;
for no layman dared do this, seeing him so carried away by the desire
to rule and in possession of the military force. Some of those fathers
went to the palace (Father Geronimo de Ortega, lecturer in theology,
bearing the decree) and gave <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href=
"#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>themselves into the power of the
usurper&mdash;who, ignorant of their mission, at once received them; he
answered the fathers with insolence, using offensive language toward
them.</p>
<p class="par">The speaker [<i>i.e.</i>, father Ortega] explained to
him that the colleges of the Society always stood and would stand with
open doors to receive the king our sovereign, for its members are his
loyal vassals; for that reason the religious while awaiting the
decision of the usurper, patiently endured not only the epithets cast
at them by the ignorant rabble, calling them &ldquo;traitors&rdquo; and
&ldquo;rebels,&rdquo; but also the language of even Fray Francisco
Solier who spoke to them very rudely. There were also other annoyances
which I must omit, and which should be imputed to Fray Francisco and
his guardian and to the commissary of the Holy Office; for although
each one of these ought to have been attending to his duty, ambition
kept them all three at the palace, which they did not leave for a
moment.</p>
<p class="par">The usurper, carefully seeking arguments for a reply to
the auditors in order to justify his purpose&mdash;and on one side
being stimulated by conscience to the blind obedience which he ought,
as a vassal of his Majesty, to give to the royal decree; and on the
other, being dominated by self-love and the ambition to gain power and
riches, which distracted his mind&mdash;tried to obtain from some of
his mercenary confidants those arguments which were best suited to his
desires, as among those who surrounded him there were not lacking some
in whom depraved purposes had the ascendant. Don Juan preferred the
advice of his special confidant, Don Francisco de Figueroa, who
counseled the usurper to notify the people that the royal Audiencia
which was at the house of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href=
"#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>Society because the auditors had gone
there to organize it, had sent to the palace to summon him under
penalty of treason to his Majesty if he did not at once render
obedience; that accordingly all should consider whether or not it was
expedient for him to go. [He advised him], as is proper in a community,
to go about but a little while waiting for those persons of highest
station who form its head. Figueroa showed his cunning by notifying
some of his intimates to reply (as they actually did) that it was not
expedient for the usurper to go to the Society&rsquo;s house; but that
the auditors should come to hold their sessions in their customary and
proper place, the hall [of the Audiencia], and that then he was under
obligations to obey [the summons]. Thereupon the rest agreed with this
opinion of the first speaker; and, in order to justify his evil conduct
and impute it to the people, he caused them all to assemble
together&mdash;although some recognizing the mistake avoided this by
going out without being noticed, being overlooked among those who were
discussing the affair; and with the above decision they sent away the
religious.</p>
<p class="par">The usurper tried in various ways to break up the
assembly of the auditors and the city officials, who were at the
Society&rsquo;s house. The first was a plan to beguile with promises
Captain Don Nicolas de Pamplona, one of the two alcaldes-in-ordinary,
to induce him to leave the house; and this succeeded, on account of his
lack of sense. For, carried away by those promises, he asked the
auditors&rsquo; permission to go to his house and visit his
wife&mdash;who, as they informed him, was in the pains of
childbirth&mdash;protesting that he would return; but as soon as he
went out, he went to see the usurper, who ordered him not to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>go back under penalty of being a traitor to his
Majesty&mdash;without heeding that Don Nicolas was an
alcalde-in-ordinary and could not be subordinated to him, even if he
were legitimately the military governor, but only to the auditors, who
directed the civil government.</p>
<p class="par">It was not so easy to persuade his companion, General
Sebastian Rayo, who, as a man of ability in these matters, knew that
the royal person resided in his court and not in the usurper. The
latter, in order to trample on any opposition to his plans, committed
the greatest iniquity than man&rsquo;s imagination can conceive; this
was to avail himself of his intimate friend the commissary of the Holy
Office, to take General Rayo under pretext of [a requisition from] the
Inquisition from the Society&rsquo;s house. The commissary, carried
away by his own personal aims and his ignorance and taking advantage of
the peace and quiet prevailing among the people (which, he hinted, was
[the result of] his own religious zeal), gave orders, as commissary of
the holy tribunal, to Don Geronimo de Leiva, commissary in the province
of Ylocos, and to Captain Don Luis de Monrroy, notary of the Holy
Office, to go with their badges displayed and in behalf of the
Inquisition. They summoned the said alcalde, Sebastian Rayo, who as a
Catholic Christian immediately obeyed&mdash;much to his cost; for the
usurper, annoyed that he had to employ the holy tribunal in order to
secure the general, availed himself of the suit that Don Diego de
Salcedo had brought against him, and kept him a long time prisoner in
his house under the guard of soldiers.</p>
<p class="par">The city council being thus broken up, the royal
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>court still remained entire, which gave the
usurper no little anxiety in plotting the means most suitable for
securing the object of his longing. For this purpose he sent a message
to the auditors that they must within a very limited time hold their
sessions at the palace, under penalty of death if they did not obey,
since they were causing disturbances and were violating the peace; and
he declared that he would aim the artillery at the college of the
fathers.</p>
<p class="par">In these and other unheard-of evil acts the usurper and
his counselors continued; and the auditors went on issuing writs to the
more prominent citizens commanding that they should, under penalties of
death and being considered traitors to his Majesty, render obedience to
the auditors, since the royal person resided only in his court. These
efforts were useless, for the guards posted by the usurper permitted no
person to leave or enter the house; but the auditors spent two days and
a night in these occupations without descending from their tribunal for
a moment&mdash;with courage enough to render up their souls in the
service of his Catholic Majesty.</p>
<p class="par">The usurper was surprised to see his designs frustrated,
and, knowing the great love that Don Francisco de Coloma had for his
wife, made arrangements, availing himself of the cunning and subtlety
of his counselor General Don Francisco de Figueroa, that the latter
should go in company with General Francisco Garcia del Fresno in his
name to talk with the wife of Se&ntilde;or Coloma, giving her to
understand that if the auditors did not depart [from the
Society&rsquo;s house] within the limit of three hours, he had already
resolved to end the affair in blood. The unhappy lady, as soon as she
heard this decision from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href=
"#pb40" name="pb40">40</a>]</span>the envoys, entered her sedan-chair
and went to the Society&rsquo;s church; she sent some one to call her
husband, and they remained alone in conversation. The result of this
meeting was, that Don Francisco without being seen by any one entered
his wife&rsquo;s chair, leaving her in the church, and went to his own
house. Thus the wickedness of General Figueroa, the usurper&rsquo;s
counselor, succeeded in breaking up the royal court, since the only
persons remaining were Se&ntilde;or Mansilla and his Majesty&rsquo;s
fiscal.</p>
<p class="par">That the usurper might better take vengeance on Don
Francisco de Mansilla y Montemayor, he assured him through the agency
of the father vicar-provincial Fray Diego de San Roman, and the
schoolmaster Fray Juan de Paz (who were shining lights in the Dominican
order), that Se&ntilde;or de Mansilla and the fiscal could go with all
safety to their own houses, and that he would do them no injury;
consequently they began to feel relief from the extreme hardship that
they had suffered. On the next day the auditors were unable on account
of their fatigue to repair to the Audiencia; and immediately, on that
same night, [the usurper] ordered the arrest of Don Francisco de
Mansilla by the soldiers, placing him in the castle at the port of
Cavite. He ordered the guards under severe penalties not to allow
Se&ntilde;or Mansilla to speak to any person, and this lasted many
days. At the entreaties of the superiors of the religious orders he was
allowed to receive communion, but not to leave the castle&mdash;where I
will leave him, in order to continue with other things that were
happening.</p>
<p class="par">The tyrant had obtained his greatest desire, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>terrified [any who might oppose him] with the
example of Se&ntilde;or Coloma. The usurper proceeded with his rule,
rewarding most those who most deserved punishment for their enormous
crimes. He appointed persons to offices giving the chief and best one,
which was that of Calamianes, with the title of sargento-mayor of the
fleet of Yloilo to Captain Don Gonzalo Samaniego, the only nephew of
his best friend, the commissary of the Holy Office&mdash;who also
recommended those who showed themselves most prominent in the arrest of
Don Diego de Salcedo. This the tyrant readily and gladly followed,
giving the charge of the Sangleys&rsquo; Parian to Captain Diego de
Palencia, and honoring with new appointments as admirals Captain Don
Juan Robles y Cortes and Captain Don Juan de Vargas Machuca; and he
rewarded not only the others who assisted in the said imprisonment, but
those who most aided the usurper for their own private advantage.</p>
<p class="par">As the usurper was supplied with a large quantity of
money&mdash;that which he had seized from Don Diego, and the
situado<a class="noteref" id="xd21e524src" href="#xd21e524" name=
"xd21e524src">9</a> which had just arrived from Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a&mdash;he undertook to be generous at the cost of his
Majesty in order to conciliate others, issuing money-orders and making
payments at his pleasure. Accordingly, the first business which he
despatched was to issue a warrant to himself, not only for what the
king owed him, but, as that was not sufficient for him, [he added]
several thousands more on account of what would yet be due for his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>official services;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e529src" href="#xd21e529" name="xd21e529src">10</a> and for his
son, a boy of eight or nine years, who held a military
office&mdash;which, as it was needless, Don Diego would have
abolished&mdash;he ordered the certification and payment of the entire
amount. To satisfy those whose support was important to him and to
justify himself to the people, he ordered that all the arrears [of pay]
which the royal treasury was owing to the auditors be paid in full; and
afterward [only] what he allowed was paid to them. Nor was anything
paid to such persons as were not concerned with the arrest of Don
Diego, or at least [approved] his detention in prison.</p>
<p class="par">As so much property had been seized from Don
Diego,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e534src" href="#xd21e534" name=
"xd21e534src">11</a> especially in jewels and gold, there was occasion
for temptation to the most upright man when the inventories were made;
and, after it was placed in the royal treasury, for cunning schemes to
acquire many ducados with this wealth.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e537src" href="#xd21e537" name="xd21e537src">12</a> The first
scheme, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span>which was adroitly planned by the usurper&rsquo;s
confidant General Figueroa, was that all the gold which had been seized
should be sold&mdash;alleging the pretext that if it were kept for a
later time it would depreciate in value, and his Majesty would incur
great loss; for at this time, as the foreign ships were here which came
to procure gold, it had [a greater] value. Without any one&rsquo;s
understanding the matter, all the gold whether wrought or not was sold
at auction to the said General Figueroa at the rate of fourteen pesos a
tael (which is a weight of ten silver reals) for the wrought gold, and
thirteen pesos a tael for the unwrought; but he had previously
bargained with the foreigners to take all the gold, at seventeen pesos
a tael for the wrought and fifteen for the unwrought. [This was done]
so that the usurper might divide up the surplus with a profit of more
than 14,000 pesos, the proceeds on the quantity of six thousand taels
(counting wrought and unwrought) which was placed in the royal
treasury. As I remonstrated that this baseness had been committed
against God and the king, they were fearful and reopened the auction on
the following day, saying that the usurper was unwilling that all the
gold should be sold to one man only&mdash;as if it would be difficult
for craft to arrange that the gold should be divided up among ten or
twenty persons, all tending toward the same end, that of their
selfishness and greed. Recognizing their object, I alleged
that&mdash;granted that their intention is that all the gold should not
be sold to one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>citizen only, for which reason the sale of the
preceding day was annulled&mdash;after I asked the price of the gold, I
desired to obtain 1,000 taels of the unwrought gold, offering on the
spot fourteen pesos a tael for the said gold, and saying that, if I
were allowed to carry away all the unwrought gold at that price, I
would take it. They showed surprise and were annoyed at me, but finally
concluded the sale at the said price of fourteen pesos. Only some 1,400
[taels] were sold, leaving the rest for other auctions; and it was not
certain, [to judge] by those that afterward were held, whether all the
remainder of the gold was sold at the same price of fourteen pesos; for
some lots were knocked down at thirteen pesos.</p>
<p class="par">For these and other evil acts Fortune supplied the
usurper, for a notary with the man who has the worst reputation and
most malicious designs of any in these islands, named Tomas de
Palenzuela y Zurbaran, who is well known to everyone. The usurper
prepares his documents and despatches with this man only, in whom he
has great confidence and by whom due form is given to his unjust and
illegal acts. Further, the fiscal of his Majesty has demanded by
repeated letters, that [the gold] be not sold; but he has never
answered these or numberless other letters which the said fiscal has
written regarding the imprisonment of Don Francisco de Mansilla, and on
various other matters which he has demanded (as he is continually
doing). And as the fiscal was ill, the usurper appointed Licentiate
Antonio Quijano, an advocate in this royal Audiencia, that he might be
present, as he has been on behalf of the fiscal, at the auction sales
which have been made of the goods of Don Diego. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The religious orders persisted in asking for the release
of the auditor Don Francisco de Mansilla, as also did many influential
persons; but they did not succeed. They caused the usurper, however,
much sorrow at seeing that the auditor had so much popularity, while
his own tyrannical disposition desired that all the citizens should
countenance his iniquitous conduct in the unjust imprisonment of the
auditor&mdash;which his own fears had accomplished, since the session
of the royal Audiencia could not be held without Se&ntilde;or Mansilla;
for no one was left except Se&ntilde;or Coloma, and he could not
constitute the Audiencia alone and without another auditor. It is clear
that his ambition craved adulation of his evil act, for tyranny always
experiences profound fears and suspicions, which conscience
stimulates.</p>
<p class="par">To palliate his wicked conduct toward the innocence of
Se&ntilde;or Mansilla, he schemed to bring suit against him for
trafficking in barter and merchandise&mdash;although the poor gentleman
never intended or even imagined engaging in that pursuit&mdash;bringing
forward witnesses according to his own liking. Among those who were
sworn was one who was the most malicious intimate of General Don
Francisco de Figueroa; and he testified before the above-mentioned
notary, Tomas de Palenzuela y Zurbaran, the declared enemy of the
imprisoned auditor. It was a divine Providence that Se&ntilde;or
Mansilla was not accused of an infamous crime, for that would have gone
through very easily.</p>
<p class="par">The usurper became tired of the said letters from the
fiscal of his Majesty, who, sick as he was and is, in order not to fail
in the obligations of his office, was continually at work at the
evident risk of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46"
name="pb46">46</a>]</span>health in requiring the information that was
due him&mdash;although without any result; for, as I said, they now did
not answer his letters, and their only care was to find some way of
exiling him, declaring that he was a disturber of the peace. Indeed, I
think that no long time will elapse without his being suspended from
the exercise of the office that was conferred upon him by his Majesty;
and the cause of that will be [the usurper&rsquo;s] wicked
intentions.</p>
<p class="par">The tyrant knew well that among so many there could not
fail to be some loyal hearts who, as they could not for lack of power
check his insolent acts, did not openly express their desire to avail
themselves of whatever opportunity time might present to distinguish
themselves in the service of both Majesties; and even if they could not
do so with deeds, at least they would write to his Majesty giving him
an account of all that had happened, so that the prompt remedy that so
difficult affairs as these require might be applied, and the islands
not be exposed to destruction. Although these islands are in the view
of so many nations, nothing of what I have related leaked out, so deep
was his mistrust; for he took precautions by detaining here the ships
from all the neighboring kingdoms without permitting one of them to
depart until the middle of January&mdash;at which time no one could
reach the English and Dutch ships, which sail every year from Batavia
and Ba[n]tan for Europa in the middle of December&mdash;in order to
hold this government for a longer time (of which we who are loyal
desire [to give] information) instructed by his confidant, the traitor
General Figueroa. The losses and expenses which he caused to the
ambassadors of kings, the owners of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47"
href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>private ships, by this detention
cannot be estimated; nor can I relate the complaints which all uttered
regarding this unexpected action.</p>
<p class="par">For the greater suffering and punishment of the
community, the demon kept the usurper so blind that he concluded that
he could with money perpetuate himself in the government. Accordingly
he opened the door for greed by means of his chaplain, who is an
outcast Carmelite from Mexico. This man, on account of serious
disturbances which he caused in his province and the murder of their
provincial by some of his associates, with another man of his faction
was, with them, banished to these regions, their sacred habits being
taken from them. As soon as this man arrived at these islands, the
tyrant, who was then an auditor, sheltered him in his house; his name
is Don Gabriel Coronel; and the agreements in lawsuits and the gifts of
all the traders are settled with him.</p>
<p class="par">[Complaint was made by] the ambassador of the king of
Siam and his factor&mdash;who came to take care of the goods which he
carried on account of his king, in order to dispose of them profitably
in this city&mdash;and another Moro, a citizen of the said kingdom,
named Juan Guaroni, who came with the ambassador as administrator of
the property which the ruler of the said kingdom had surrendered to Don
Diego de Salcedo. It was demanded from him for purchase, [and
comprised] thirty-two cates and nine onzas of musk; thirty-two onzas of
ambergris; ten bezoar stones, and one of porcupine; six pieces of
sarasas;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e566src" href="#xd21e566" name=
"xd21e566src">13</a> six [word omitted?] of cocoanuts; and eight
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>pieces of chintz&mdash;altogether worth 3,500
pesos, for which they had not been paid. For, a few days before the
imprisonment of Don Diego, these goods had been handed over, and the
contract had not even been solemnized; and then, as the said arrest
occurred, they proceeded to the presence of the commissary of the Holy
Office asking that the said goods be returned to them or else that they
receive satisfaction for their just value. He commanded that a copy [of
this demand] be given to the party [concerned], who immediately
acknowledged the entire amount; besides, they proved by a great number
of sworn witnesses that the said goods had been handed over to Don
Diego, and no payment had been made for them. The affair being so
thoroughly verified&mdash;as will appear by the said acts, to which I
refer&mdash;the said commissary refused to give any orders until the
ambassador and the others understood the road [to be taken] and availed
themselves of the expelled Carmelite, the usurper&rsquo;s chaplain; and
an agreement was reached with him, and they purchased justice for seven
hundred pesos&mdash;five hundred pesos for the usurper, and the
remaining two hundred for his intimate friend, the commissary of the
Holy Office. They handed over the silver by the hands of the said Don
Juan Guaroni, the said ambassador and all being scandalized at seeing
persons of so high position committing so shameless
acts&mdash;especially the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href=
"#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>commissary. As a proof of his lack of
sense, he went out one day through the public streets with his badge
exposed, hanging from a bunch of little gold chains; and during a
period of more than two months continuously all the officials of the
holy tribunal went about wearing their badges displayed, to the offense
and general dread of all the people. As for the condition in which
these islands are, I leave it to the most moderate person to consider
[what it must be] when they are governed by an usurper&mdash;[and that]
through his chaplain, a man expelled from a religious order so austere
as is that of the Carmelites of the City of Mexico; he is also a friend
of Father Paternina, a revengeful man, who for his own private purposes
accused, by writing, before his provincial a religious of his own
province named Fray Cristobal de Leon, a native of Monforte de Lemos.
[This Fray Cristobal] had attained in his order all the most honorable
positions save that of provincial; [but Father Paternina accused him]
of practicing usury and being a Jew, [pursuing him] with such
persistency and hatred that he did not halt until he had caused Fray
Cristobal&rsquo;s death by a rigorous imprisonment. For this religious,
in view of the unjust treatment inflicted on him, taxed the said
commissary with being disqualified for being his own relator,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e603src" href="#xd21e603" name="xd21e603src">14</a>
since he had been a galley-slave sentenced by the general of his order
at the convent of Burgos. Witnesses were brought forward, men who had
served on that very galley&mdash;in particular, a religious named Fray
Diego Gutierrez, a son of the convent of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>San Felipe el Real at
Madrid, who related the affair with abundant proofs and affirmed that
it was true; indeed, I had several times before heard it from witnesses
worthy of confidence.</p>
<p class="par">The tyrant remained in constant mistrust at seeing that
although he held the auditor Don Francisco de Montemayor a prisoner in
the castle at the port of Cavite, he was distant not more than three
leguas from this city, and that he might make his escape some night and
cross the bay in some little vessel and come to join Se&ntilde;or
Coloma; then they could form a quorum of the Audiencia and punish the
lawless acts that he had committed. In order to prevent such a
suspected emergency, he determined to exile the auditor<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e613src" href="#xd21e613" name="xd21e613src">15</a>
to the province of Oton, or to some other at a distance of more than
200 leguas from this city; and this was done, the blow being inflicted
on December 30 of the past year 1668 (the tyrant adopting the nefarious
scheme of his notary, Tomas de Palenzuela y Zurbaran) with a party of
paid soldiers without the poor devil knowing where his voyage ended.
For this purpose, the notary carried to the castellan of the said port
of Cavite<a class="noteref" id="xd21e616src" href="#xd21e616" name=
"xd21e616src">16</a> (a confidant of the usurper) an order that he
should, as soon as he had received it, command his sargento-mayor,
Captain Juan Gomez de Paiba, to go with a sufficient number of soldiers
and the notary to take away from the fort the auditor Don Francisco de
Mansilla and place <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51"
name="pb51">51</a>]</span>him aboard the champan which was already
prepared for this voyage. When they undertook to execute the said order
against the person of the said auditor, the latter notified the
sargento-mayor not only once but several times to be careful what he
did, since a mere sargento-mayor was not the person to arrest a
councilor of his Majesty; that this matter belonged to no inferior
official, and that he would not go without an order from the royal
court. He declared that if his person were treated with disrespect, he
would regard the officer as a traitor to the king; and as the civil
governor (which he is) he ordered him to summon the castellan, for he
already imagined evil to himself. The sargento-mayor went out, and came
back with the same order&mdash;adding that if the auditor refused to go
on board willingly they would place him in the ship by force. They had
stubborn controversies; then the father vicar of St. Dominic at the
said port came up and advised the auditor what was best for him at the
present time, regarding which they did not agree. Finally the
sargento-mayor ordered, since his castellan had thus commanded, that
four soldiers, the strongest in his detachment, should attack the
auditor. The latter defended himself for a long time with a small staff
that he had in his hand, declaring and protesting that any man who
should dare to injure his person was a traitor to the king; but finally
he gave up exhausted, and they carried him aboard the
champan&mdash;which immediately set sail without giving him opportunity
to take with him anything, whether clothing or comforts, for his
personal use. All this occurred at nine o&rsquo;clock at night on the
said day, December 30&mdash;the poor gentleman leaving his house
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>and his family of marriageable daughters
unprotected, in unending affliction and tears, without knowing to what
place their father had been banished.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e623src" href="#xd21e623" name="xd21e623src">17</a></p>
<p class="par">The usurper made strenuous efforts to learn who had
consented to his having, by securing the command and authority,
trampled on the obedience that was due and which he ought to give to
the commands of the royal court; and, as he succeeded in learning that
I was one of those who most keenly resented his acts&mdash;with some
other gentlemen, although not many&mdash;and that I had rendered
obedience to the royal decree which the auditors had sent me and had
very carefully observed it while they were in power, he conceived a
special hatred against those who were of my opinion. This was
particularly directed against me on account of my not having displayed
and showed to him the royal decree, which, as I say, I hold; another
reason was, because I had said as I now say, that the commissary of the
Holy Office could not carry out the arrest of Don Diego without
consulting the supreme authority&mdash;except in a case where he feared
the flight [of the accused]. And even if any governor intended to act
thus, the [interference of the] Holy Office was not necessary, since
the royal Audiencia was more than sufficient to secure his person. But
I do not say that the father commissary may not have sufficient
authority to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>make, as he did, the said arrest. For this reason,
and because I am a loyal vassal of his Majesty, with a few other
gentlemen toward whom the usurper felt no good-will, he [treated us as
he did] without further cause than the deposition of a captain named
Don Juan Manuel de Corcuera. This man declared that his comrade,
Captain Don Luis de Matienzo, had told him that Don Diego had sent to a
lady a list containing the names of those who were loyal, in order that
they might release him from the rigorous imprisonment in which he was
and is,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e630src" href="#xd21e630" name=
"xd21e630src">18</a> and replace him in his command and government. He
said that the said Captain Luis disclosed it to him, and showed the
said list to General Don Fernando de Bobadilla, charging him to make me
acquainted with it, in order to make arrangements for setting his
Lordship at liberty. The usurper found [in this a] means for his
vengeance, and accordingly gave immediate information to the father
commissary, his intimate friend&mdash;who on December 13 of the past
year 68, about eight o&rsquo;clock at night, ordered that all of us
concerned therein or on the [above] list should be arrested.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e633src" href="#xd21e633" name="xd21e633src">19</a>
This order was executed during the day-break watch, and we were placed
in this fortress of Santiago&mdash;General Fernando de Bobadilla, a
well-known <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>gentleman of Sevilla; Sargento-mayor Don Nicolas
Sarmiento y Paredes; and myself. In other dungeons, in the guard-house,
they confined Admiral Juan de Ytamarrin; the captain of cuirassiers,
Don Antonio Lopez de Quir&oacute;s (who was in Flandes); and Captain
Don Luis de Matienzo, a dependant of his Lordship. The strictest orders
were given [to our guards] on penalty of death, that no one could see
us or speak to us, and besides, to keep us all in strongly-riveted
fetters, and in dark and close dungeons.</p>
<p class="par">As all men went about in fear and amazement at what they
had seen, the infliction of harsh treatment and imprisonment on the
said Don Francisco de Montemayor without his prerogatives as councilor
of his Majesty and one of the civil governors availing him, it was not
necessary to know more than that the usurper sent to summon any man at
an unseasonable hour of night in order to have him promptly taken
within the church [<i>i.e.,</i> for sanctuary]. Accordingly as soldiers
went on the night I have mentioned asking for General Don Diego Cortes
and his Majesty&rsquo;s factor, Sargento-mayor Juan de Verastian, those
persons knew that they were under suspicion, and were smuggled into the
convent of San Nicolas in this city belonging to the discalced
Augustinians; the convent was immediately searched. He secured that the
church was of no avail to them, since those persons were also
proscribed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>[<i>i.e.</i>, by the Inquisition]; however, the
soldiers did not come across them.</p>
<p class="par">The prisoners spent one week thus confined and harshly
treated, and at the end of that time they conveyed us all closely
guarded and [exposed] to public shame to the tyrant&rsquo;s
palace&mdash;which was full of people, who came to see what had never
before been seen&mdash;men of rank and station conveyed in such guise
and with so great clamor. The guards proceeded through the halls
passing us from one to another until we reached the next to the
last&mdash;where sat the usurper with Licentiate Manuel Suarez de
Olivera, whom he appointed as associate judge, and who was receiving
the confessions of all. Without any blame resulting [to us from these]
and without giving us a copy of the charges, they notified us of our
banishment and stated that this was done at the request of the father
commissary of the Holy Office, for the greater security of the custody
and person of Se&ntilde;or Diego de Salcedo. Immediately they sent on
shipboard General Don Fernando de Bobadilla and Sargento-mayor Don
Antonio Lopez de Quir&oacute;s; and as I replied that they must give me
time in which to settle the accounts of his Majesty&rsquo;s royal
income, since I had just been exercising the office of alcalde-mayor of
Tondo, they granted me only ten days.</p>
<p class="par">As for the cause of our imprisonment, he said that it
was because we had intended to rescue Don Diego and kill the usurper
and the master-of-camp. I was not ignorant that the usurper had no
authority to try my cause&mdash;even though he were the legitimate
military governor, and I had committed a crime&mdash;since I did not
hold a military post. It was the civil governor who should try this
cause, all the more if the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=
"#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>crime is that of taking human life;
moreover, [the usurper] introduces himself as judge of his own cause.
Much less [should he try the cause] if the crime [alleged] belongs to
the Holy Office, since it has exclusive jurisdiction&mdash;not to
mention other arguments, which I here omit. The other [prisoners]
fearful of irritating further a man who is riding so with loose
reins&mdash;so violating the laws, both human and divine, following
only that of <i lang="la">Sic volo, sic jubeo</i>,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e659src" href="#xd21e659" name="xd21e659src">20</a>
etc.&mdash;but protesting that they would oppose him when a suitable
opportunity arose&mdash;.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e664src" href=
"#xd21e664" name="xd21e664src">21</a> I would write numberless other
things here, if my condition would permit me the opportunity; but this
I have not, since even to write these lines it was
necessary&mdash;since I remain in this rigorous imprisonment,
surrounded by guards who watch the steps that I take and the words that
I speak&mdash;to write by snatches with the utmost caution and care
that the guards should not notice what I was doing on account of the
evident danger to which I shall expose myself if the usurper knows it;
and when I finished a sheet I sent it immediately to the college of the
Society of Jesus. I ought to be pardoned, therefore, for the blots on
my manuscript, and other defects, since I had to keep my attention on
the door, lest the guard should enter and catch me at this.</p>
<p class="par">It is no wonder that hostile tongues condemn the father
commissary, Fray Jose Paternina, as having acted with passion in the
imprisonment of his Lordship, for various reasons. First: his Lordship,
before coming to these islands, while he was in the City <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>of
Mexico had carnal intercourse with a woman who was a relative of the
said commissary. The latter came to know this, and declared himself the
mortal enemy of his Lordship; and thus arose and began, while they were
on the voyage to these islands, a strong aversion, which was kept up
during the voyage, and was public and notorious. After arriving at this
city they were on very bad terms; and besides, the commissary is
ambitious, greedy, and not of exemplary life. Moreover, he is very
revengeful, keeping the city stirred up with the word
&ldquo;Inquisition,&rdquo; and summoning [before it] men for matters of
little importance&mdash;to the scandal of the community and the
discredit of those thus summoned, for no one knows for what purpose
they are arrested; this is keenly felt among our countrymen, since we
boast of being [good] Catholics, as we are.</p>
<p class="par">Another reason: He was greatly displeased at seeing that
the profitable position of alcalde was not given to his nephew Don
Gonzalo Samaniego (whom he loved and valued highly) nor even to his own
Paternity a priorate to his liking; indeed, his provincial, Fray Alonso
Guijano kept him in the convent on account of recognizing his evil
disposition, and as Fray Jose did not know the language; besides, the
provincial had other religious of long standing and ability with whom
to fill the priorates. The commissary attributed this to the
dissensions which he had had with his Lordship in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a
and on the voyage; and fancied that it was Don Diego who had arranged
the matter with his provincial, as those two were friends. There is
proof of this [my] statement; for as soon as he secured the
imprisonment of Don Diego, the first and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>most important office
that was filled was given to his nephew, conferring on him first the
rank of sargento-mayor of the armada of Oton. For himself, he made
arrangements with the usurper to receive his strong recommendation to
the priorate of the convent in this city, which was immediately given
to him by the provincial. Finally, it is he who rules the usurper; for
there is a mutual understanding between them on account of what they
could make known regarding the great amount that is lacking and does
not appear in the wealth which was seized from his Lordship&mdash;coin,
ingots, and [wrought] articles of gold, and diamonds. And he
[<i>i.e.</i>, the commissary] is at present rich and honored, respected
and feared, succeeding with whatever he wishes, pleases, and
purposes.</p>
<p class="par">As I have not time for more, I will set down the names
of those who had most to do with the imprisonment of the governor, Don
Diego de Salcedo; they are the following:</p>
<p class="par">First, the master-of-camp of this royal regiment, Don
Agustin de Zepeda, who as master-of-camp maintained the guard with a
company of Spanish infantry, who was and is on duty, as is customary,
in the palace.</p>
<p class="par">The two alcaldes-in-ordinary, General Sebastian Rayo
Doria and Captain Don Nicolas de Pamplona. The latter seized his
Lordship by the arm while he was sleeping, which caused him to awake
and sit up in his bed; and Don Nicolas held him so tightly that his
Lordship feeling the pain told him that he must not hurt him like that.
The other replied arrogantly that Don Diego had oppressed all the
people, and that they had had enough of him; and his brother, a
religious of St. Francis, Fray Geronimo de Pamplona, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>allowed
himself to say to his Lordship, &ldquo;Let us have no arguments.&rdquo;
His Lordship replied to this that he must be more civil; and that even
if the holy tribunal arrested him he would not allow any one to treat
him with insolence, because he represented the royal person.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e687src" href="#xd21e687" name=
"xd21e687src">22</a></p>
<p class="par">The sargento-mayor Juan Jirado, or Tirado; they say that
he held a dagger at the breast [of Don Diego], and as a reward they
elected him this year alcalde-in-ordinary.</p>
<p class="par">The unemployed captains Don Gonzalo Samaniego (nephew of
the commissary) and Don Juan de Vargas, whom they made admiral and gave
him the office of Tayabas; he is my brother-in-law.</p>
<p class="par">Captain Don Juan de Robles Cortes; he only remained with
the commissary, who asked that Don Juan should not leave his side; they
afterward made him admiral of the caracoas, and he was chosen this year
alcalde-in-ordinary.</p>
<p class="par">Captain Diego de Palencia, my brother-in-law, as
alguazil-mayor of the Holy Office, placed the fetters on Don Diego.</p>
<p class="par">Captains Don Luis de Morales and Grabiel de la Jara;
they went with six other men and seized the halberds; and when the
halberdiers tried to get their weapons, these men had already gained
possession of them all. Others remained at various stations in the
palace.</p>
<p class="par">The provincial of St. Francis, Fray Francisco Solier,
with the guardian of that order, Fray Mateo de la Anunciacion, who went
with a naked sword; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60"
name="pb60">60</a>]</span>and sixteen other religious of St. Francis.
All of them carrying arms entered the apartment; and the two first
named were the ones who made the most noise.</p>
<p class="par">Those who countenanced the usurper Don Juan Manuel when
he failed in the obedience which he ought to render to the royal
Audiencia when that court summoned him are the following:</p>
<p class="par">In the first place, the commissary, Fray Jose de
Paternina.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e709src" href="#xd21e709" name=
"xd21e709src">23</a></p>
<p class="par">The provincial of St. Francis, [Francisco] Solier, and
the guardian, the aforesaid Fray Mateo; they never left his side or the
palace, for which reason the government was taken by force.</p>
<p class="par">General Don Francisco de Figueroa who, as his confidant,
and being so subtle, has counseled whatever the usurper has done. He
went to the house of the Society and treacherously professed obedience
to the royal Audiencia; then by craft, under the pretext of subduing
the usurper, he gained permission to leave the house and returned to
the palace, where he gave information of what he had seen, in every way
acting [as one] without God and without king. Then followed in his very
steps the notary Tomas de Palenzuela y Zurbaran&mdash;a man who is
liable to commit any wickedness whatever on account of his evil nature
and ambition. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name=
"pb61">61</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The alcalde Don Nicolas de Pamplona, who, being in the
house of the Society and having with the city [officials] in a body
rendered obedience to the king our sovereign, as represented in his
royal Audiencia, carried away with his own shallow mind and great
ambition, left the house with the false assertion that he would return,
and presented himself before the usurper, rendering obedience to him;
this man they made commander of the armada.</p>
<p class="par">The commander of the artillery, Francisco Garcia del
Fresno, for with him and the following that he had, he authorized and
encouraged and was joined with the crafty Don Francisco de Figueroa.
These two terrorized the wife of the auditor Don Francisco de Coloma,
so that she should draw away her husband within three hours, fearing
lest he should risk his life with the other auditors&mdash;who were
maintaining the organization and existence of the Audiencia in the
library of the Society of Jesus&mdash;because they were going to
demolish that house with cannon-shots. The good lady went out in much
fear and proceeded to the house of the Society; and from her visit
followed the departure of her husband [from the house], and the
organization of the Audiencia was broken up.</p>
<p class="par">All the military officials, except the master-of-camp,
whom the auditors already held, and the sargento-mayor of this royal
regiment, Don Nicolas Sarmiento y Paredes, who obeyed the mandate of
the auditors. The usurper, angry at this, conferred that command on
Sargento-mayor Diego de Morales, who is still serving therein.</p>
<p class="par">The licentiates Juan de Rosales and Don Eugenio
Gutierrez de Mendoza; they were the two judges <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>appointed by the usurper to decide the question of
the seniority claimed by each of the two auditors, Don Francisco de
Coloma and Don Francisco de Montemayor y Mansilla; and, having obtained
the opinions of these judges, the usurper adjudged the authority to
himself.</p>
<p class="par">All these were the men who were most active on account
of their being the most influential persons&mdash;not to mention many
others of less rank; or the people who sinned through ignorance and not
through evil intention, for they knew not whom they ought to obey. As
they heard repeated proclamations of treason to the king, who was at
the Society&rsquo;s house, [with command that] they should not go to
the palace, they all took the path of obedience, as loyal vassals of
his Majesty&mdash;as they would have done without any doubt if the
usurper had given opportunity to the royal Audiencia so that the
auditors could command that a proclamation be published. But as for
those in authority, on account of their rank and station, who received
the royal decree and failed to obey it, and others who carried it to
show to the usurper, I do not say of such that they are free from
blame.</p>
<p class="par">I set down the names of all those who were present in
both encounters with full particulars, and without being moved by
prejudice; and I name my two brothers-in-law, so that no inquisitive
person may accuse me of being prejudiced. Many other names I do not
place here, since the rest are persons of less importance.</p>

commissary, induced by gifts and bribes, surrendered to the persons
concerned without keeping any record of such suits. The commissary gave
many jewels and other valuable articles seized from Salcedo to his
relatives and friends, especially to the usurper Bonifaz. The latter
appointed Diego de Palencia, one of the conspirators, as alcalde-mayor
of the Sangleys and their Pari&aacute;n, &ldquo;which is the most
profitable office that can be bestowed in these islands,&rdquo; and
royal depositary&mdash;in virtue of which latter office a considerable
part of Salcedo&rsquo;s wealth was placed in his hands, part of it
being placed in the royal treasury. Later, the commissary secured
possession of most of what Palencia held; and the usurper spent most of
what had been placed in the treasury for paying the soldiery and
securing the friendship of the citizens. (Ventura del Arco MSS., ii,

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Father Fray Carlos Clemente Gant having completed
his term of office with great glory, a chapter was held in the convent
of our father Santo Domingo in Manila, On the twentieth of April, 1641,
the reverend father Fray Francisco de Paula, commissary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>of the
Holy Office, preacher-general, then lecturer in morning classes in our
college of Santo Tomas, vicar-provincial of this district of
Manila&mdash;a son of the noted convent of San Estevan of Salamanca,
and native of Segovia, of noble parentage&mdash;whose superior talents
will be told in due time, was elected provincial with much
satisfaction. There was a great lack of religious in the province, for
no mission had come for six years, except that brought by father Fray
Diego Collado. Although some of those religious were incorporated with
the order, still many of them were dissatisfied. In short, so long as
the province does not have a number of religious in excess of the
actual number of ministries, it is a great anxiety and a cause of
sorrow for our souls that there is no supply in cases of sickness and
government, and the burdens of many are laid upon few. Further, all
this gives the devil a gleam of hope that is important to him, and most
harmful to the common welfare; and occasion is given for the ministers
to be sold very dear, and a very high value is placed on their
abilities and knowledge of languages. Therefore, a regiment of
religious, which would be too much, is never more than enough; for in
this beautiful Judith, the garments that apparently drag one down are
the most necessary. The most efficacious means, and in fact the only
one that ought to be used in such straits, was the one which the father
provincial-elect immediately put into effect; namely, to have recourse
to our Lord and the intercession of the saints, laying most stress on
his efforts with our father St. Dominic, who is the keystone of all
this edifice, in whose name are held firm these religious stones. A
novena of solemn masses <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href=
"#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>was immediately begun to the saint at
his altar of Soriano. The first one was chanted by the father
provincial, and he also despatched patents throughout the province
ordering the same supplications to be made in the convents for the said
reason, and for the field of Christendom in Japon&mdash;which was then
in its death throes, our religious having been killed and exiled, and
only a scattering of priests of other orders being left there. The
miraculous result of those prayers in regard to the coming of our
religious will be told later.</p>
<p class="par">[That chapter framed a memorial on the death of father
Fray Diego Quero, who died in the Dominican convent at Manila. He took
the habit at the island Espa&ntilde;ola [<i>i.e.</i>, San Domingo] and
lived a life of great austerity and poverty. Being of an advanced age
when he went to the Philippines, he was employed as master of novices,
and afterward as a minister. Other religious who have yielded up their
lives in the mission work are the following: Loren&ccedil;o Alduayen of
the province of Aragon, son of the convent of San Pedro Martir at
Calatayud (Spain), who labored in the province of Cagayan, where he was
greatly beloved. Juan del Moral, son of the convent of San Pablo in
Cordova, native of La Rambla, who died at the Manila convent in 1642,
where he had been master of novitiates. Geronimo de Belem, who died
March 31, 1642, was a native of Beya, Portugal, and had fled to the
Indias on account of a murder which he committed in his youth, taking
the habit in the Mexican convent of the Augustinians because the
Dominicans refused him. However, he was soon dismissed or left that
order, and shortly after was given the Dominican habit in La Puebla de
los <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>Angeles; and on reaching the Philippines became a
laborer in Bataan. He held several important positions in the order,
being vicar-provincial, twice definitor, and minister in the province
of Tagalos for many years. He was sent on an evangelical mission to
Camboja, and after various other employments met his death by accident
in an Augustinian convent in Pampanga, to which province he had been
sent to adjust some repartimientos that had been imposed on the
natives. Manuel de Berrio was a native of the town of Santa Maria el
Real of Nieva, and son of the convent of Santa Cruz el Real at Segovia.
He accompanied Diego Collado in his mission when still a young man, but
deserted that body immediately upon his arrival. He was sent to Nueva
Segovia in Cagayan, where he was well known for his virtue. He was
vicar of Fotol at the time of his death. Chapter xv treats of certain
troubles in 1642 growing out of the late Chinese insurrection. The
governor had ordered the new Pari&aacute;n to be built on the other
side of the river northeast of Manila in a barrio of the village of
Binondo, between the sea and an estuary called La Estacada by the
Spaniards, and Bayuay (or Baybay) by the natives.<a class="noteref" id=

people would be inconvenienced in going thither to supply their needs,
and the natives would be in danger with so many infidels near by, the
change was ordered; but in 1642 the Pari&aacute;n was accidentally
destroyed by fire, with great wealth belonging to the Spaniards, and a
large part of Binondo. This chapter recounts also the loss of the

resented more than is possible in other regions. Everything should be
ruled with moderation. That gentleman was an upright man and one of
great impartiality, but he began to rule with the reputation of a
peevish and reserved man; and, even though he performed miracles
afterward, he could not cleanse himself from that reputation. Or
perhaps it was because he went to extremes in the residencia of his
predecessor, which he performed so rigorously that he kept him in the
fort in prison for five years, until he received an order from the
Council to send him a prisoner to Madrid.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e823src" href="#xd21e823" name="xd21e823src">2</a> In regard to
the ecclesiastical estate he carried himself to the acceptation of all,
and with a Christian heart; we in our province found him very pious,
and he was very urgent in sending religious to China and other
kingdoms, and aided greatly in the consolation of our ministries. We
presented to him a royal decree which we had obtained from his Majesty,
ordering the demolition of a college founded by his predecessor and
styled &ldquo;royal.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e841src" href=
"#xd21e841" name="xd21e841src">3</a> Having been very clearly informed
of the great disadvantage [of that college], he duly observed the terms
of the said royal decree and abolished the said college then and
thenceforth. It had been erected without any necessity, and even not
without casting dishonor on the two ancient seminaries of this
city&mdash;one in charge of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73"
href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>Society of Jesus, the college of
San Joseph; and the other in charge of our order, the college of Santo
Tomas. Those two colleges are quite sufficient for the small Spanish
population here, and for those who apply themselves to the Church. To
erect a similar college amounted, in good Romance, to shining without
any expense, and to try to cause himself to be remembered as a founder,
although it was all paid for out of the royal treasury. It was
maintained by the aid that he wrung out of the poor soldiers, and we
complained at that. But now that obstacle was removed by the said
decree; and eleven thousand pesos were restored to the royal treasury,
and both patron and patronage were effaced at once. The great
earthquakes of Manila happened during the term of that gentleman, and
the wars with the Dutch (all of which will be related). In all of them
he showed sufficient proofs of his magnanimity, prudence, and zeal, and
that he was a good commander; and although, as a man, he must have had
his imperfections, and a favorite who destroyed much of the
governor&rsquo;s credit with the too freehand given him&mdash;however,
the governor in time learned to know the favorite, and threw him into
prison&mdash;he always showed that he was good by his example and
deeds, and, without presumption, his desire was to do right. God aided
his good intention and brought him safely through it all.</p>
<p class="par">On the ninth of August of that year died the father
commissary Fray Francisco de Herrera, whose exemplary life could fill
many chapters and even books; but we are in haste, and the substance
will suffice. [He was born of honest parentage in a village of little
report near La Pe&ntilde;a de Francia, in the bishopric <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>of
Salamanca; and professed in the convent of La Talabera in the
ecclesiastical province of Spain. Later, he studied in the Valladolid
convent of his order. He arrived at the Philippines in 1600, and
immediately began to learn the Chinese language, and later learned also
the Tag&aacute;log, becoming fluent in both languages. He served many
times as prior of various convents; vicar of Batan, of Binondoc, and of
the Pari&aacute;n; prior of Santo Domingo; vicar-provincial, and
vicar-general, during the absence of the provincial; and commissary of
the Holy Office. In 1629 he succeeded to the office of provincial.
&ldquo;In the office of provincial he exercised great zeal, and not
less prudence; and as he was so capable and had been in the province so
long, he knew all the religious of the province very well, and gave
each one the employment that fitted his nature, which is truly the gift
of governing.&rdquo; He was austere in his observance, and charitable
to all, and visited the sick. He sent missionaries to China during his
term. At the completion of his office he was elected rector of Santo
Tomas college, which he held for two terms, being then elected prior of
Manila. Lastly, he ministered in the hospital, where he died, being
buried in the Manila convent.]</p>

<p class="par">The following year, namely that of 645, the provincial
chapter was held in the convent of Santo Domingo at Manila, in this
province. In it was elected for the second time the reverend father
commissary, Fray Domingo Gonzalez, a septuagenarian, whose resistance
and the argument of his advanced age did not avail to let him escape
the charge. Had he been content with acting moderately the first time,
he would have avoided the agonies of the second term. But although he
was a man so fearful of God and so prudent that he even fled from
extremes and always aimed at the mean of virtue, yet in the part which
subjects the government to the beginnings of charity, he was not
contented, but must go to extremes and become too charitable.
Consequently, since he was so charitable, that did not avail him to
become exempt from the office of superior. He filled the office for
nearly three years, until death had pity on him, since he did not
resist it in the fulfilment of his obligations, nor could his brethren
excuse him from the weight of it. In due time we shall relate the
characteristics of that glorious column of this holy province, for
there is much to tell. In that chapter were received the ordinances of
our most reverend Rodulfo of happy memory, given in Roma in the former
year of 640, in which the houses which were to have a vote in the
intermediary congregation (whose first deputation was made in the
provincial chapter of the year six hundred and thirty-three) were
changed. [We also received] other ordinances. But another form was
finally given to this in the conference of the year 650, where
opposition arose<a class="noteref" id="xd21e864src" href="#xd21e864"
name="xd21e864src">4</a> to the acts abrogating <span class=

providing at the request of this province that their term be no more
than two years. The authority of the acts of the general chapter of
Roma was given afterward to that decision, in that same year of 650.
That chapter also confirmed it in the title of the ordinances of this
province. Doubtless that is a very important and useful arrangement,
not so greatly for the spiritual case of the Indians, who rejoice to
see themselves cared for by many different fathers, as for our own use;
for the good pilot must not keep to one ship, but serves God better
when free and less when bound down.</p>

<p class="par first"><i>Of the intermediary junta; and of the life of

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The intermediary junta was held May 25, 1647, in
the convent of Santo Domingo in Manila. In that junta were passed some
special declarations, although only three, and the rules were only
repetitions of the past ones. As ever, this holy province has proceeded
with great caution in imposing laws, for it is careful lest many new
laws confuse the memory of the old ones; and lest one embarrass the
other, if there are a multitude of laws. Laws are the walls of the
order; but there may be so many of them that they bind the order too
much, and smother it, or make a labyrinth&mdash;especially since the
religious are few in number and ready to obey to the letter, without
its being necessary to talk with the community, so that one single
individual considers himself as comprehended by it, even though the law
appears unjust to him. But if there are many laws, the order becomes
afflicted. In that junta it was declared that the obeisance need not be
given to vicars-general as a right but that it can be given as a sign
of reverence if the provincial is absent. That has always been the
custom and appears to be an excellent one. It was also declared that
the rules which are not general, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78"
href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>only bind rigorously in the
chapter in which they are instituted, and not in the following ones in
which they are confirmed; for the declaration that they are confirmed
is only that they may be observed, and that they may not be regarded as
obsolete so soon. The venerable and ancient provincial, Fray Domingo
Gon&ccedil;alez, commissary of the Holy Office, was present at the
junta, and he left that second station, which is one of great anxiety,
with soul greatly refreshed for the prosecution of his duty. But
although he did not leave his office imperfect he did not finish it;
for the Lord, having been satisfied with his pious desire, took the
burden from his shoulders in the month of November following the said
junta, in order to let him pass to the better life, regarding as good
his seventy and more years (of labors from his youth up). He died on
the fifth of the said month, leaving great sorrow, not only to the
religious, who lost an excellent father&mdash;one of the most loving
that this province has had, and one who has most illumined it&mdash;but
also to outsiders, both religious and laymen, by whom the father was
greatly revered.</p>
<p class="par">[He was born in Madrid, and took the habit in the
convent at Guadalajara, being afterward sent to study in the convents
at Salamanca and Valladolid. After serving in various posts in Spain he
went to the Philippines in 1602, where he almost immediately attained
renown. Being sent to Nueva Segovia to learn the native language, he
applied himself so well that he became most fluent in it, and used it
with the natives for five years. Finally returning to Manila, he became
an active and efficient worker there. He was the first regent of the
College of Santo Tomas, and lecturer therein, also acting as rector
various <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>times. He became provincial for the first time in
1633, and during his term was most careful in the visitation, going
even to the island Hermosa.]</p>
<p class="par">[The following chapter continues the same matter. The
great fervor and devotion of the father gave him the commissaryship of
the Holy Office. During his second provincialate he was also assiduous
in the visitation, and died shortly after the intermediary junta of
1647 at the age of seventy-three. He left many writings in scholastic
and moral theology, which were widely used after his death.]</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">After the death of the father commissary, Fray
Domingo Gon&ccedil;alez, the province was left in tears and orphaned,
because of the lack of columns of that kind in the spiritual edifice;
although it is true that such loss will not be the cause of its ruin,
for God is the only foundation. But necessarily such losses leave the
province sorrowful and wounded; and one who can fully supply the
vacancy left by a father who looked after his causes with so great
love, and whom all obeyed with so great satisfaction, is not found so
easily. Notwithstanding, the foresight of our Elias was able to provide
a successor already experienced, a disciple of his own spirit, who
succeeded him the first time;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e907src" href=
"#xd21e907" name="xd21e907src">6</a> and he now charged the fathers
before his death to make that man provincial, although <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>he was
very aged, being sixty-six years old, albeit a person of good health.
Accordingly, he was elected provincial on the second of May, 648, in
the convent of Santo Domingo without any opposition. The choice was
loudly applauded, both by the province and by the city, for the new
prelate was well liked by all, because of his great authority, his
impartiality with affability, his zeal with discretion, and his
prudence attested by proofs. Although it is true that years usually
imprint their changes on men, yet ability makes them superior to the
laws of time; and since they are, in addition, on a road that they have
traversed, they enter it immediately with many advantages, and act
definitely from the beginning&mdash;thus avoiding the suspension of
government with which necessarily those who do not know the path must
begin. In order to govern the definitors, and to dispose of the
offices, it is very important to have an acquaintance with the persons
and to have visited the provinces and villages, in order to be free
from arbitrary notions, and to enter upon the functions of his office
from the first with a master&rsquo;s experience. The prior of Santo
Domingo was vicar-general, and presided at the election. When he
finished his term of office, that same year, the fathers of the convent
chose as their prelate the father commissary, Fray Juan de los Angeles.
He, by great importunity and the influence which God gave him in the
minds of devout persons, freed the convent, which was then deeply in
debt; and rebuilt the church which had been in ruins since the
earthquake. He left that church very strongly built of stone, and
greatly beautified by its corridors and galleries, and its many
windows&mdash;which make it very sightly, and give it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>much
light, extent, and beauty in the choir. It still remains today one of
the best churches in the city. As the said father is still living, it
will suffice to tell in due time all that he has done in this province,
which has been much. It is certain that the province owes him a great
debt for the honor he has conferred on it, and his works, although his
love for it does not permit him to be idle.</p>
<p class="par">In July of that same year a patache came to these
islands, quite beyond the scanty hope that we had. But the providence
of God&mdash;which, as we have said so many times, measures the
stability and preservation of this field of Christendom with a distinct
rule, and not with ordinary ones&mdash;placed in the heart of the
viceroy of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a (since it had been two years since any
ship had gone hence) to make the said patache go down to Acapulco from
Realejo.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e916src" href="#xd21e916" name=
"xd21e916src">7</a> There he put aboard of it the situado and necessary
supplies, and entrusted the vessel to General Christoval Romero, a
perfectly satisfactory person, who had had experience in these lands,
who was then detained at Mexico. It was our Lord&rsquo;s pleasure to
grant him good winds, so that he reached these islands, although with
the anxiety that one can understand; for he feared that already the
Spanish name had been blotted out of them. The reason why no ship had
sailed was that which we have said regarding the Dutch enemy; and for
two years we had done no little in defending ourselves from their
stubborn hostility. The said commander made port at the harbor of
Lampon, either because it was suitable, as he feared the enemy, or
because he could do no more. He learned there that the Dutch were still
committing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>piracies along those coasts and endeavoring to
recoup themselves for some of their past losses. Everything was a
miracle, and no less than had happened many days in those ports; and
the day when the said patache entered, God covered it with the shade of
a cloud so dense that it was sufficient to hide it from the enemy. As
soon as they anchored, they put ashore the money and supplies, and sent
it all as quickly as possible to Manila. They had need of all their
diligence, for, the cloud having been taken away, the Dutch hastened to
search the anchoring-places. Finding that the said patache had escaped
them, and that it had already cast anchor in a safe port, they launched
their small boats well manned with crews and arms and some versos. Our
commander having seen that as he had no men to receive them, and his
ship was of poor sailing qualities&mdash;as it was the only means left
to him in his necessity, after seeing by the mercy of God his men and
the money safe, set the patache afire at its very moorings, and then
with the few sailors who had remained with him retired to the mountains
whence he made his way to Manila. The enemy, who saw the ship converted
into ashes, seized, as a small revenge, only some small pieces [of
ordnance] that the fire left, for nothing else remained. It was the
last admonition that God&rsquo;s powerful hand was immediately
defending these islands. With that the Dutch left the islands, and have
not had the slightest inclination to return to them. The reception
given in Manila to the said commander (and truly, on account of the
circumstances of that time, this had been the most welcome succor which
these islands had received since their discovery) was to incarcerate
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name=
"pb83">83</a>]</span>him in the fort of Santiago. Keeping him in very
close imprisonment, a suit was commenced against him for lack of
courage, because he had burned the patache before it was necessary. The
trial proceeded in such fashion that the judge-commissary, who was a
lawyer of the royal Audiencia, sentenced him to decapitation (although
in the universal belief he deserved a monument), without his
allegations that he had burned the patache because he had no men with
whom at least to show front, and that those whom he had were worn-out
and undisciplined, not being of any avail; nor did they heed his
statement that the king lost but little in an old boat without arms or
equipment, and that he considered that it would be rash to have shown
any opposition to the enemy. The sentence appeared too severe to the
royal Audiencia, but not ill-founded, as reputation had been lost, and
that is the most delicate gift and the most priceless. Thus can one see
in these matters the fear in which we live here. The matter was taken
by the advocate to the Audiencia in degree of appeal. The common
opinion was that the people were grieved that so great a service should
be paid with such harshness, and that, to attend to reasons of state,
one should break with the holy laws of gratitude. The whole matter was
examined in that most just assembly, and it was decided to moderate the
above sentence and measures so that justice might not complain. In that
way did God favor the said commander, and he obtained his liberty, and
has since held honorable charges in the service of his Majesty. Today
when this is written (the year 676), he is castellan of the presidio
and forts of Cavente [<i>sc.</i>, Cavite], which is one of the best
ports in these islands. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href=
"#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span>We all had part in the consolations
and advantages of that fortunate patache; but this holy province had
more than all, for a large mission came for it. That vessel brought
thirty religious,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e929src" href="#xd21e929"
name="xd21e929src">8</a> who were in charge of father Fray Juan
Bautista de Morales, who, as we have said, and as we shall tell more at
length when we write his life, went to Europa by way of East India in
1640. Now he returned with this fine company of soldiers, selected by
the hand of God for these missions of His. He came also with many
benedictions and favorable despatches from Roma and Espa&ntilde;a. He
brought to the convent of Manila the jubilee<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e935src" href="#xd21e935" name="xd21e935src">9</a> of the forty
hours for fifteen years; it was assigned from the fifteenth of
September, and care is taken to ask in time for its continuation by the
apostolic see. He brought one also for San Juan de Letran and another
for San Juan del Monte. He also brought an apostolic bull, from his
Holiness Innocent Tenth of blessed memory, for the erection of a
university in the college of Santo Tomas of Manila, and letters from
the king our sovereign (of which we shall treat later); and the
resolutions which were taken in the holy city of Roma in regard to the
administration of the fields of Christendom in China (which we shall
also tell). He also brought many other despatches and rules which
concern the order, which will be mentioned when this history demands
them. The religious who came in that mission are <span class=

<p class="par">That fine mission was received with the charity and
pleasure that can be understood, especially as there was a great need
of religious&mdash;who, when there are but few of them, experience
great hardship and sorrow; and, after having suffered these when their
number was few, they now attached no importance to them. But God helped
them in their greatest need, and the father provincial who began to
rule fortunately had a very encouraging beginning in his office, and
promised himself that he would accomplish not only the half of his
work, but all with the aid of God, and with that of sons and associates
who were so courageous. He went about <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>distributing them among
the various languages and places of labor, and immediately commenced
his visits, which is (and rightly) the matter of greatest care. It will
not be well to pass by in silence both the excellent reputation enjoyed
by our sacred order of this holy province, and the aid that it receives
by the help of the divine grace in preserving itself in humility, and
free from worldly considerations and dignities, which do not fail to
make some stir in the silence of the cloister. It is a fact that in the
most general chapter held in Roma in the year 1644, in the warrant that
concerns this province (number 12) favor was granted to it by which
those who should have lectured in arts and theology for twelve years in
the college of Santo Thomas of Manila should have a vote and place
after the fathers who should have been provincials, inferior to them
and among themselves respectively. Also (in the same chapter),
preachers-general are instituted with a vote and concessions, if they
have been ministers to the Chinese for twelve years in the hospital of
San Gabriel. The province received those favors and indults with all
the due expressions of humility and thankfulness. But it petitioned
from them in consideration of the fact that it had been founded without
those special rules; and in that manner it was going joyfully on its
way to its object&mdash;namely, the employment of all its cares in the
welfare of souls, in the learning of which (for the will has its
schools also) all the other faculties live here subordinated. On that
account, in each chapter or junta all the ministries are changed, and
with the same facility the other offices, without consideration or
pretext of reward, or any dispute arising. And although those appointed
to the said occupations <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href=
"#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>serve God and the order well, yet
since the province thought that that might possibly distract them, or
make them consider with less resignation, the changes which are
continually made, therefore the province petitioned our reverend
father-general and the ensuing general chapter to be pleased to revoke
the said concession. The arguments having been examined, this petition
was allowed in the general chapter at Roma in the year fifty; and the
said concession was revoked with great praise and edification, which is
made evident therein; for the chapter praised the zeal of this
province, which thus cares for conserving itself in a holy simplicity
and readiness, so that the care of its authorized employments may not
confuse its principal end&mdash;namely, that all of them engage equally
in the work until death, so that when death comes they may await all
the reward together, when they will not be defrauded of a high place
and will be paid in better money.</p>
<p class="par">[One of the despatches received by the province was of
deep import. This consisted of the decisions rendered by the
Congregation de Propaganda Fide in Rome, on certain questions asked by
Juan Bautista de Morales in regard to Chinese missions and mission
work, the method of administering the sacraments there, and the
preaching of the faith. These questions and answers (translated into
Spanish) follow in chapter xxxv, and are followed by a decree of
approbation passed by the Propaganda on September 12, 1645. The
&ldquo;resolutions,&rdquo; as they are termed, are for the sake of
securing uniformity in the administration of the sacraments and the
preaching of the faith in China, &ldquo;among all and any missionaries
of whatever order, religious body, or rule of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>life,

<p class="par first"><i>Of the events of this time within and without
the province, and the deaths of some religious of renown.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">[The chapter opens with a notice of the so-called
&ldquo;holy year&rdquo; or jubilee of 1650, proclaimed at Rome. That
same year the general chapter of the Dominican order was held at Rome,
and resulted in the election of Fray Juan Bautista de Marinis as
general of the order.]</p>
<p class="par">That same year this province celebrated a junta and
intermediary chapter of the second provincialate of the father
commissary Fray Carlos Clemente Gant, in the convent of Santo Domingo
at Lalo, in Nueva Segovia or Cagayan, as was ordered by number one in
the general chapter of 1647, at Valencia, for this province. This was
to the effect that the chapter-sessions should be held alternately
between the convent of Santo Domingo of Manila and the aforesaid
convent of Lalo, for reasons alleged by the ministers of that
bishopric. They had to sail, every two years, one hundred and more
leguas exposed to very great dangers and violent seas [in order to
attend <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>the chapter], and thus left their missions
discommoded; and they needed a great sum of money to procure large
boats, to pay the rowers and sailors, and for the other things that
they considered. Notwithstanding that, experience, the mistress of
prudence, afterward disclosed great inconveniences, and that those were
only the opinions of a few religious and that they themselves
experienced the greatest dangers that follow. For although it is a fact
that the voyage is dangerous, yet if it be made at the proper season
and the return be made by the first of May, without making any
way-stations, the sea is quiet. By God&rsquo;s mercy, prosperous
voyages have always been made; and the fathers provincial make them two
or three times during their four years. It is also advantageous for the
religious themselves [to make that voyage to Manila], for then they can
get what their houses and churches and the Indians need; and they can
arrange it personally, and satisfactorily to themselves, and they act
as agents for those who remain there. The chief advantage is that the
chapter-sessions have the authority that they require in the capital of
Manila, where all the orders and their congregations hold them with
more definiteness and less trouble in general. Although some
individuals do suffer somewhat, yet with that they acquire merit; and
absences are easily filled in their ministries, for vicars-general
remain who attend to that. For the above and other reasons, a petition
was made in that general chapter of Roma in that year 1650, where the
reasons were stated, and the said order was revoked (<i lang=
"es">titulo pro provincia Filippina</i>, number 4); and it was
confirmed in the general chapter held in the said holy city (number
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>1). Consequently, from that time thenceforth that
difficulty has been removed, and all the fathers come [to Manila] very
willingly. Some letters were received in that junta from the most
illustrious Fray Domingo [<i>sic</i>] de Marinis, then vicar-general of
all the order; and others from our most reverend father, Fray
Tom&agrave;s Turco: they annul a decree of the most reverend Fray
Nicol&agrave;s Rodulfo given in the year of 40, ordering that the
vicariates last four years. Being informed of the reasons which were
alleged, it was recognized that such measure was not advisable (we have
already touched upon this matter above, and there will always be
something to say about it). This is a holy government for all, which,
well considered, redounds to the greater utility of the houses and
villages, where he who is a perfect religious is not troubled at
changes&mdash;for he is quite unconcerned whether he serves God in this
or in that ministry; and wherever he is there is work to do, and a
place where he may well employ his courage. As for him who regrets to
leave a house it is better for him to leave it after he has served his
two years. He should endeavor to fulfil his obligation and to gain a
reputation as one who does not mind such things, without embarrassing
himself with thoughts of changing from one vineyard to another, which
generally obscures talent. Our profession holds us captive to
obedience, but leaves us free in regard to all temporal considerations.
The minister has great self-love, more than the Indians, and thinks
that he will not be disturbed after two years, however much the
wretched beings say to him and flatter him.... The said revocation was
confirmed by the said chapter in that holy year [of 1650] (number 2 of
the ordinances <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>concerning this province). <i>Item</i>: Vote was
given to the rector of Santo Tom&agrave;s in provincial chapters and
juntas; and likewise other letters-patent so that any vicariate that
should be vacant should give a vote in the junta. Between the chapter
and the said junta, the provincial shall appoint another vicar after
consulting some of the fathers. But if it shall become vacant between
the intermediary chapter and the election, a consulting junta shall be
held, in the province of Manila, of the fathers-counselors and the
rector, in order to institute the said vicariate, which can have vote
in the ensuing election; but if the vicariate be instituted in any
other way, it shall not have a vote. Thus they were presented in the
said junta and were received. The ordinances of the above-mentioned
chapter of Valencia of 1647 were also accepted. In regard to the orders
contained in them touching the provinces of Indias in general&mdash;in
ordinance 6, that neither the provincials nor the chapters can give
permission to the religious to return to their provinces of
Espa&ntilde;a, petition was made to our most reverend general, in
behalf of this province, to exempt it from that observance for reasons
that were advanced. In consideration of those reasons, his Reverence
and the general chapter of Roma conceded us that favor in the said year
of the jubilee, in the section treating of this province (number 3),
granting permission to the father provincial who should be in office at
that time that, the reasons of the religious who wished to return
having been examined, he might assemble the council of Manila and
represent the matter to it; and, in accordance with their vote, the
religious shall be or shall not be sent, without its being necessary
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>to have recourse to the reverend generals. Of a
truth, it was a most just arrangement, not only because we are twice as
far [from Roma] as are the other provinces of Indias, but in accordance
with the special rule and ordinance of this province. Although there is
always a great need of religious in it, yet he who is rendered
disconsolate is superfluous, and willingly becomes a violent soldier
who gives and receives signal injury&mdash;although God does not wish
that they complain of what is given to them. The illness of the man is
learned in this consultation, and the remedy is immediately applied
without exigency or delay, which is not slavery. Those who return to
Espa&ntilde;a and do not keep this holy province much in mind are very
few, when they are undeceived, and find that that bad humor was in
themselves, was not the fault of the land, and that they must live with
unrest in this world; for the center of our desire is heaven, for which
we are born. In no place can we live with greater freedom and,
consequently, with less fear and more quiet unless we go hunting for
encumbrances to put in it. <i lang="la">Unusquisque in suo sensu

<p class="par">[The deceased religious mentioned in that junta are as
follows: The lay-brother Fray Juan de San Jacinto, who died in 1648,
was a son of the convent of Valencia, and on account of his good work
was sent to Japan. After his return to Manila he was sent to Spain
(1630) by way of East India, and returned by way of Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a. Christoval de Leon, of the royal convent of Granada,
died at the age of seventy in the province of Pangasin&aacute;n, that
same year. He had filled some important offices in the order, among
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>them being definitor (1633), and prior of the
Manila convent, returning thence to his labors in Pangasin&aacute;n.
Geronimo de Sotomayor Orato, a native of Mexico and son of that
convent, and Tom&agrave;s Ramos, son of the convent of San Vicente in
Plasencia, who had been captured by the Dutch, died at sea while being
sent back to Manila. Pedro Benitez died in 1650; he had been assigned
to the Nueva Segovia missions, where he was studying the language at
the time of his death.]</p>
<p class="par">[Chapter li continues the mention of certain deceased
religious. Francisco de la Trinidad died as bishop of Santa Marta, in
the Indias, in 1663. In 1651 he had been sent as procurator from the
Philippines to Spain and Rome, being at that time prior of the Manila
convent; and he served as definitor for his province at Rome in 1656.
He was a native of Vizcaya, and had taken the habit in the Philippines.
Martin Real de la Cruz died in the bishopric of Cagayan in
1651<span class="corr" id="xd21e1006" title="Source: :">.</span> He was
a son of the convent of Carboneras in the province of Espa&ntilde;a,
and became a fellow in the college at Valladolid. After arriving at the
Philippines he was sent to the bishopric of Nueva Segovia, where he
learned the language perfectly; and he wrote many sermons and
discourses, which were preserved in manuscript and copied for the use
of the order. He became rector of the college of Santo Tom&aacute;s at
Manila, and at the same time first rector and chancellor of the
university erected in that college in 1648. On the completion of that
office he returned to his missions in Cagayan, and died in the remote
missions of the Babuyanes Islands. In the same bishopric died also
during that period Lucas Garcia, at the age of seventy-six. He
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>had a perfect command of the language, and was a
sympathetic and arduous missionary worker. He acted more than once as a
vicar-provincial, and went to the island of Hermosa, where he labored
among the natives and Spanish soldiers. After serving as rector of the
college of Santo Tom&aacute;s he returned to his missions in Cagayan,
where death met him. The lay-brother Francisco de San Agustin died in
the village of Lalo, in the same province, a helpful and humble worker.
In the convent of San Jacinto, outside the walls of the City of Mexico,
died in the year 1651 Sebastian de Oquendo, a native of Oviedo in
Castilla. He had been minister to the Chinese of the Pari&aacute;n, and
had lectured in the arts and theology in the college of Santo
Tom&aacute;s. The Manila convent of the order was served by him in the
office of prior; and he also preached in that city with great success,
leaving many writings in manuscript on scholastic theology, which were
used long afterward. At death he was buried in the convent of San
Jacinto, where he was serving as prior. His body was found uncorrupted,
in 1658, by some Dominican missionaries en route to the
Philippines.]</p>
<p class="par">The most novel event in the year 1651 in the city of
Manila was the imprisonment, by order of Governor Don Diego Faxardo, of
the person of the master-of-camp, Manuel Estacio Benegas, who then
filled that office at Manila. That happened on September 16 of that
year, and his property was confiscated at the same time. He was a
native of Granada, and came to these islands as captain of infantry in
the service of the king. Because of his blood, which was said to be
noble, and his excellent conduct, he was well married here, and had
many sons <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>and daughters who have always managed to preserve
themselves with splendor and to keep up their reputation with
[official] employments and equal marriages. His arrest was a very great
innovation, for from the time when the said governor assumed his office
he had honored the master-of-camp, arriving [at the islands] thus, with
notable standing, the governor, seeing him capable and experienced in
all matters, almost made him his Hercules, and placed in his hands the
keys to everything. He made the master-of-camp the only and necessary
go-between in all his arrangements and secrets. That was followed, as
its inseparable corollary, by what is called a change of fortune; for
he thought that he had mounted so high while the impetus of his wheel
remained very low. Although the master-of-camp made many friends, he
raised up against himself a greater number of enemies&mdash;either
querulous or discontented at seeing that a superior whom God made a sun
because of his office, so that he might be a universal and
[un]mistakable cause, had been appropriated and set apart for himself.
That alone was enough to affront and offend the most retired inferior.
And although Hercules cannot prevail over two, much less over so many,
his enemies made such attempts to secure his downfall and studied over
the matter so much that they laid a scheme to embroil him with the
governor, who had purposely shut himself up and extinguished all the
lights&mdash;one of warning, while behind it entered the rest of the
troop. He was immediately thrust into a very close and dark prison, and
all his property was sequestered; and gratitude and confidence, taking
the part of the many who were aggrieved, became the plaintiffs who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>made the most criminal charge. Therefore, since
the said governor was a just man, and without any doubt upright and
even inflexible, he was not satisfied with aggravating the
imprisonment, but had torture applied to the prisoner&mdash;which was
very severe, and more so in a man as corpulent and as delicate as he
was. The cause, charges, and acquittals proceeded, but before the
sentence was reached the master-of-camp died in prison, giving tokens
of being a true Christian, and with a great submission to the will of
God, who had without doubt disposed him for that road for salvation;
for he was a very intelligent man, and his capacity availed him there
greatly. And what do we know might have happened to him had he died in
a condition of prosperity? Incomprehensible are the ways of divine
Mercy.</p>

of the Pari&aacute;n in the insurrection of 1630&ndash;40 rendered it
necessary to build a new one; this was placed at La Estacada (so called
because the site was stockaded for this purpose), farther from the
gates of Manila, but within range of the guns of Fort Santiago.
Notwithstanding the inconveniences attendant on this measure, and the
risk of demoralizing the Indian converts, the government refused to
locate the Chinese elsewhere; but they remained there only two years.
One night when they were worshiping their ancestors, a house
accidentally caught fire; as a result the entire Pari&aacute;n was
burned, with great quantities of goods belonging to the citizens of
Manila, who had placed these there on sale. A great part of Binondo was
also destroyed by this fire. (Diaz&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Conquistas</i>,

<p class="par first"><i>Chapter, and election of provincial; and events
in those times</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On April 20 of the year 1652, the members of the
chapter were assembled in the convent of Santo Domingo in Manila, and
elected as provincial the reverend father Fray Pedro de Ledo, then
prior of that said convent and vicar-provincial of Tagalos. He was a
person of all good qualities, a native of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>Mexico, and of noble
parentage in that city. He took the habit and professed in this convent
of Santo Domingo in Manila. In his studies he gave so good an account
of himself that he lectured in arts and theology, and became regent in
our college of Santo Tomas. He always had the name of an excellent
student and learned man. On that account, and because of his great
prudence, known to us by experience, the religious elected him to the
post of provincial, which he filled very successfully and with great
credit. Among the special events of that chapter was the announcement
of the new university of Santo Tomas and its apostolic erection by a
bull which his Holiness Innocent Tenth, of blessed memory, was pleased
to promulgate at the instance of the king our sovereign, Felipe Fourth
the Great. His Majesty, as sole patron, was pleased to put his hand to
that&mdash;an honor very worthy of publication by the chapter; and,
although it was current in all the province, that solemnity was still
to be performed. The house of San Miguel of Ituy, in the province of
Nueva Segovia, was also accepted. That is a great stretch consisting of
heathen settlements for the greater part, although there are some
Christians among them, some of whom are those who flee from other
villages. It lies on the eastern border of the province of Cagayan, and
extends from some high mountain chains to the coast; and, as it is so
rough a land, it has not yet been possible to conquer it, although many
attempts have been made, the religious going sometimes with and
sometimes without soldiers. Missionaries have also been appointed on
various occasions; but although they have baptized many persons, they
have not been able to convert <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href=
"#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>them all. As vicar of the said house,
the chapter then appointed father Fray Teodoro de la Madre de Dios, and
gave him some priests as companions. They went thither with a presidio
of Spanish soldiers at the command of the governor, who so ordained it.
Many of the soldiers and two of the religious&mdash;father Fray
Bernardo Cejudo and father Fray Manuel Rincon&mdash;died because of the
poor climate or poor food. They all remained there, that time, for two
years, and baptized many people there; and those natives long continued
to embrace the law of God. But either because of the sickness, which
had developed into a plague; or because those Indians were at war
continually with other people of the interior, more powerful, who
greatly persecuted them, and the faith of Christ: for all those causes,
and because they could not cope with so many dangers and troubles so
long as the natives were not quiet, the presidio that was still left
retired to Cagayan, and the fathers returned, as they had lost hope of
obtaining more fruit. However, our religious are accustomed to return
there every little while, where some are baptized, and those who have
made their decision do not fail to come; and the province does not lose
sight of those posts, for the time when the Lord shall be pleased to
summon them, and when they shall respond with resolution. They are
numerous; and, since they live so far inland in this same island, it is
well seen that it is very pitiable to behold them so buried in their
darkness&mdash;or not to see them, for they flee from the light. It is
not easy to form a judgment on what passes in this very island; for,
since it extends for almost two hundred leguas, and all of the seacoast
in all parts is subdued, all the fastnesses <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>of
the mountains are inhabited by numerous peoples of various nations and
languages, morally impossible to subdue, although great efforts are
being and have been made. The reason therefor is, that since it rains
so much in these lands, in addition to the so powerful heat of the sun,
and there is so little stone, such thickets and undergrowth spring up
that one can penetrate them with difficulty, and [it is even difficult]
for the very animals of the forest. Consequently, nature has defended
those people with a thousand walls. Then too they are children of
idleness, and live on roots, the fruits of trees, and the flesh of
game. They have no other granaries than those of their own bellies, nor
more clothing than that which they get from their mothers. At the most,
they wear a bajaque or breechcloth made from the bark of a tree, and
which conceals but ill the token of their sex. They have no villages,
but live in rude collections of huts or in camps, and in certain shacks
which rise a vara above the earth, where they take refuge when it
rains. When they feel the cold too keenly, they light fires and sleep
in the ashes. Their life is as follows: When they rise in the morning,
the robust ones go hunting the deer with arrows or dogs. If they kill
one, they take it to their camp; and there they all eat it, half raw,
half roasted, without salt or bread. If they do not have meat, they
find roots and fruit, and so do they satisfy their hunger without
further exercise of reason. And, since they are totally without reason,
they have no form of religion or worship, except certain superstitions
concerning the flight and songs of birds. Such is their wretched
existence; and therefore do they grow up with the understanding of
brutes, without care or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=
"#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>foresight. Some descend the
mountain to trade with our Christian Indians. The latter approach them,
and carry iron for their arrows, and rice and other things which they
know well&mdash;especially tobacco, but which they are not accustomed
to sow. Neither do they accustom themselves to any other kind of work.
This island so abounds with these people that they are encountered at
six leguas from Manila. By means of such communication they hear our
Christians, who talk to them of our holy faith, and they approve it.
But when they hear that the Christians pay tribute and bandalas, and
that here are personal services (which it is necessary to have, for a
civilized and domestic life) they return to their liberty. Some are
reduced, but it is generally a fact that this becomes continually more
difficult so long as the Lord who died for them does not drive from
their side that enemy who makes them daily more obstinate and hard.</p>
<p class="par">Late in July of the year 1653, the ship from Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a anchored in the port of Cavite, more fortunate than most
of the vessels that have been seen since the discovery of these
islands. It brought four personages&mdash;no less than the archbishop,
the governor, the bishop of Cagayan, and an auditor. It had been some
years since a ship had entered Cavite, for they all had to put back to
other ports because of the bad weather. And although, wherever they
finally enter, they discharge their cargo and assure the safety of the
money, yet doubtless it is always a considerable loss that the ship
does not come direct to Cavite, and, being laden with expenses and
aver&iacute;as, at least one-third of its good fortune is dissipated.
It had been twelve and more years since these islands <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>had
had an archbishop; for one who came to them consecrated during that
time, namely, his Excellency Don Fernando Montero de Espinosa, was
obliged to come overland, as the ship anchored in the port of Lampon;
and, when he arrived at the lake of Bay six leguas from this
city&mdash;whither some persons from the cabildo had gone beforehand to
receive him&mdash;he was suddenly overtaken by a severe illness, from
which he soon died without the Church, his spouse, having enjoyed
anything except letters and good news. And, lastly, came the evil of
its widowhood before he had taken possession of it or seen it. For that
reason all through that period there was considerable trouble, wherever
trouble exists. But there is more here, where before a successor is
obtained another six or eight years elapse. Now indeed did the lack
become doubly felt, for not even one of the three suffragan bishops of
this metropolitan was left; for if there are any bishops it is a great
consolation. For then, although it is after the trouble of making
voyages, students, religious, and secular priests are ordained, and
there is recourse for all that episcopal dignity demands, and it is the
shadow of a great relief for all Christians, although the bishops are
distant. It was God&rsquo;s will to allow his Excellency Doctor Don
Miguel de Poblete&mdash;a native of Mexico, in whose cathedral and in
that of La Puebla de los Angeles he had held the greatest
dignities&mdash;to arrive at that time. He was received here with great
demonstrations of joy. The governor was Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lara,
knight of the Order of Calatrava, a native of Malaga. He filled his
post excellently, and was generally well liked by all; for he was very
affable, pious, and not at all harsh like <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb103" href="#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>the former governor.
He had his troubles, of which we shall speak; and having governed for
more than ten years his residencia was satisfactorily finished, and he
had the good fortune to return to his country. The bishop of Cagayan
was his Excellency, Master Don Fray Rodrigo de Cardenas, of our holy
order and from the province of Per&ugrave;, of whom we shall speak in
the proper place. The auditor who came in that ship was Don Salvador de
Espinosa, a learned and zealous man; and so much so that he began to
work at matters of government before the proper time. For he
immediately, seeing that there were but few Spaniards in the country,
thought that he had learned all about it in a short time; and went
about passing sentences and issuing manifestos, more a result of his
erudition than from any necessity for it. His last offspring bore the
character of admonition and was printed. All estates were grievously
wounded by it&mdash;a serious matter when there is no one to take up
the defense. His zeal might have been useful, but assuredly no service
to God or the king followed; for his Majesty does not desire his
vassals to be maltreated, but will consider it a great service if his
ministers employ their great erudition in maintaining justice,
observing it in all the villages, and honoring all, especially the
ecclesiastical religious, and not in saying pretty things (with which
they load one down when they consider that it will make their own
dignity more estimable)&mdash;especially with these printed papers,
which, since they are printed, give us more permission to make public
complaint. Like that of another paper which was printed in the year
1671&mdash;which finally brought its author to the earth, even before
knowing the names, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104"
name="pb104">104</a>]</span>it left persons both ecclesiastical and
religious badly besmirched. In order to vaunt his erudition, he
despoiled the living altars of their best ornament, namely, honor; and
he did not hesitate to dedicate and send it to the feet of the greatest
Majesty. But he will have had his answer already. The other admonitory
pamphlet, when it was issued, seemed so foul to its very author that he
himself went about collecting and burning it. Supposing the first an
arbitrary statement, the second was Catholic and made by a person
erudite and desirous of salvation. He lived for a while, for a mortal
accident happened, and he paid his debt and had himself buried in the
convent of Santo Domingo. To the great luck of so fortunate a ship,
which brought so grave persons and those of the greatest distinction
for these lands, was added the relief of money, which was larger than
usual, as well as that of individual persons....</p>
<p class="par">[This chapter records the death (in 1653) in the Manila
convent of father Fray Juan del Villar, a native of Luzena, and son of
the convent of San Pablo el Real in Cordova. He went to the Philippines
in 1635, and applied himself to the study of Chinese and taught in the
college of Santo Tom&aacute;s.]</p>
<p class="par">Among other ordinances passed by that chapter, as they
were necessary, was one that declared that no one could be employed in
the office of lecturer in our college of Santo Thomas unless he first
learned some one language native to that country&mdash;not because
there is any logic in it, which must precede the sciences, but, since
the first foundation of this province is that of the preaching and
missions, all must know a language. He who does not know one, even if
he be a very learned theologian, does not render <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>all
the service that he can; and he does not have the good fortune to be
sent by his prelates or to have a change of climate, which is perhaps
important to his health. On arriving from Espa&ntilde;a it is the
custom for all to be divided, according to the arrangements made by the
prelate, in the study of the various languages. With their pious desire
and the master that is given them, he who can not learn enough in one
year in order to make himself understood as a preacher and confessor in
a language must be very dull. With such sound beginnings they are not
embarrassed afterward in other occupations, since, when a place in the
ministry becomes suitable, the greatest difficulty is found to have
been conquered. Of greatest use on the sea is he who knows the duties
of sailor and artilleryman; and as time goes on it becomes a matter of
disconsolation for a religious to find himself without a language, and
at an age when it is impossible to learn it, while it is a matter that
might have been overcome in a brief time at the beginning.</p>

<div class="argument">
<p class="par first"><i>Of the intermediary junta, and of a new mission
sent to the kingdom of China</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the junta held in the convent of Santo Domingo
in Manila in the year fifty-four, there was no new ordinance to pass;
for all matters were well ordered, and this holy province always
refrains from making new laws, which (like the impositions of new
tributes) the obedience of the subjects always considers with more
annoyance than respect. For since they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>are the life of the
monarchy, when there is any need, and its health, so also are they
generally feared when they can be avoided; and when new ones are
imposed, the old ones become distasteful. The provincial (who was then
father Fray Pedro de Ledo, a man of great devotion and zeal), seeing
that no ministers had left these islands for Japon since the year
thirty-seven, as the gates had been shut to them and even walled up for
our sins and those of that wretched land, tried to get together a
mission for it; and, in order that he might not have cause to envy the
explorers, he determined to go himself as prelate. But he always urged
secrecy in the plan as the essential part, and only revealed it to
those interested&mdash;namely, father Fray Raymundo del Valle, father
Fray Pedro de Ansa (an oldtime minister of Cagayan), and father Fray
Antonio de Barrios. He also shared the secret with the person who was
to remain as vicar-general during his absence. With that intention,
which was facilitated by his courage and pious desire, he bought a
champan under pretext that it was to be used for the service of the
province of Cagayan, and that he was lading it with supplies and
ship&rsquo;s-stores for the said province (as was a fact). He spent a
large sum in that, and even despoiled some churches of their money.
That was without any doubt a harsh measure; for although the property
of the convents is common here, and the provincial can take from one to
aid another, in accordance with the ordinances of this province, yet
that kind of goods and property are generally bought with the alms of
the natives of the villages, given by them especially for their
churches. Consequently an injury was done, even though it be as was
alleged <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name=
"pb107">107</a>]</span>on that occasion, namely, that he thought that
there was a superabundance of alms. Since all the adornment of the
tabernacle and of Solomon&rsquo;s temple falls short for divine
worship, and these natives do not remember or take much note of leaving
or not leaving their property in immemorial writings, their memories
are indelibly impressed by seeing that they have given it by their
sweat to the church, and they leave an honorable luster on a lamp and
some candlesticks which they gave, and which remain, making a barangay
honorable. The father-provincial, who was a prudent and erudite man,
must have considered it all; yet notwithstanding, as he thought that
the common right of a mission so important as Japon was greater than
are the alms and the said gifts, the matter could not be regulated, and
he used it all. The end was most lofty, the means which he chose very
fitting&mdash;as were the three religious, who were the most suitable
in the province; and the champan was staunch. All being concluded, the
essential wheel of those plans was lacking, namely, the will of God
without which one can never succeed. [The efforts to attain the
Japanese mission proved fruitless, but the provincial succeeded in
sending five missionaries to China. The remainder of the chapter treats
of Chinese affairs.]</p>
<p class="par">[Chapter vi relates in part the work of the mission to
China. Chapter vii mentions certain missionaries who have died. The
lay-brother Raymundo de la Cruz died gloriously after earnest labor.
Geronimo de Zamora died in Cagayan province after a ministry among the
natives of thirty-eight years, besides serving as commissary of the
Holy Office. His native city was Zaragoza, and he professed in the
convent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>of that city. He was rector of the college of
Santo Tom&aacute;s, definitor in the year 1652, vicar-provincial four
times in Cagayan, and ordinary in nearly all the houses of that
province. Juan de las Casas also died in the same part of the province.
Bernardo Cejudo died while engaged in the conversion of Ituy. He had
reached the Philippines in 1648, and his life was one of austerity and
earnest endeavor. Matias de Armas also died in 1655 in the province of
Cagayan. He was born in the island of Tenerife in the city of Laguna,
where he took the habit. In the Philippines he became a master of the
Cagayan and Tag&aacute;log tongues, acting as vicar in Cagayan, and as
vicar of Abucay in 1645. In the years 1638&ndash;39 he was in the
island Hermosa, where he studied that language while awaiting an
opportunity to go to China (which was unsuccessful). At his death in
1655 he was vicar of Afulug. Alonso Navarro, president of the Chinese
hospital of San Gabriel, died that same year in the Manila convent.
During his thirty years in the Dominican province he ministered to the
Filipinos (being very fluent in the Tag&aacute;log language); served as
definitor, vicar of many houses, and vicar-provincial; and built the
church in the village of Binondoc. In Cagayan also died that year Pedro
de Aniza, an earnest missionary who had acted as vicar-provincial and
ordinary of many houses. He solemnized many baptisms among the hostile
people of Irraya and those in the mountains.]</p>
<p class="par">In 1656 father Fray Jacinto Gali of the province of
Aragon, son of the convent at Girona in Catalu&ntilde;a, was elected
provincial. By his excellent qualities, and the proofs that he had
shown of his great prudence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href=
"#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>and devotion in the course of the
twenty-four years that he had spent in this holy province, he was
worthy of the supreme dignity of its government. He learned very
perfectly the difficult language of the Chinese, to whom he ministered
often in the Pari&aacute;n and in Binondoc. He also knew the
Tag&aacute;log language thoroughly; and thus accomplished much in both
languages. The province, desirous of elevating to the highest pinnacle
the one who would advance their order with the activity and integrity
that such an office demands, elected him their head. His election was
well received both within and without the house, for all were
acquainted with him and knew that his merits had called for so
honorable an occupation many years before. He began to exercise it, but
God, satisfied with his holy desire, blocked his steps in a short time;
for at his first departure, when he went to visit Cagayan, having
arrived there a mortal illness attacked him in Lalo. There, after he
had received the sacraments, and had taken farewell of his province
with most tender and paternal speeches&mdash;not unaccompanied by the
sobs of all the religious, who had hastened at the report of his
illness&mdash;he gave his soul to the Lord in the eighth month of his
provincialate, on New Year&rsquo;s day of the year 1657. That [such was
his death] is understood by the tokens that his great virtue and
devotion left to us. That was a perfect New Year&rsquo;s day for his
soul, which will never grow old in his time. Before he went upon the
said visit, Governor Sabiniano Manrique de Lara and the royal
Audiencia, urged by their narrow-minded zeal as ministers of his
Majesty, put a new pressure upon us. Through the fiscal of the king it
was intimated to us <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110"
name="pb110">110</a>]</span>and to all the orders that we were to make
a presentation of the lists of the chapters, as is done in the other
provinces of the rest of the Indias. This is a very delicate thing to
treat in a history, and it has cost many entreaties before God and His
most holy mother our patroness&mdash;not because of the inconveniences
that are feared from the royal piety of his Majesty, the king our
sovereign, nor of the impartiality and justice of his ministers, who
will know how to govern this matter with that fear of God and with
prudence, as they do other matters; but because we ourselves fear in
these conversions which are so tender, where perhaps the tying of the
hands of the mother will mean the loosening of those of the children,
which will render them restless, with greater difficulty in subduing
them than in other provinces less remote from relief and remedy. What
happened in that case was that we petitioned with due submission, and
stated our reasons (although all our reasons cannot be taken to so
lofty and grave courts); and as a consequence the royal Audiencia
allowed us to continue our present custom, which we maintain not only
from our rules, but from the foundation of this province, and sent the
records to the royal Council of the Indias, where the matter was
examined. In that year the province sent as definitor to the general
chapter father Fray Juan Lopez, son of [the convent of] San Estevan in
Salamanca, lecturer in theology, and regent of the college of Santo
Thom&agrave;s of Manila. He later became the most illustrious bishop of
Zibu and ascended to the archbishopric of the said city of Manila. We
shall discuss him more in detail in the year of his death, which
occurred lately, to the universal sorrow of these islands. Authority as
procurator-general <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111"
name="pb111">111</a>]</span>was given to father Fray Francisco de la
Trinidad in order that he might accompany the former. He was already in
Madrid, and afterward became the most meritorious bishop of Santa
Marta. The provincial having died, the prior of the convent of Santo
Domingo of Manila, where the chapter of the coming election was to be
held, namely, father Fray Lucas Montanero, became vicar-general
according to our rules. Having called the conference or junta of the
province, he set the time and day for the following chapter, namely,
April 21, 1657, and it was held by arrangement of the said conference
and its vicar-general.</p>

<p class="par first"><i>Great earthquake of San Bernardo&rsquo;s day;
and the mission which arrived at the province</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the year 1658, when the father commissary Fray
Juan de los Angeles was prior of the convent of Santo Domingo of
Manila, another great and formidable earthquake occurred on the
twentieth of August. In the opinion of all it was worse than that of
the day of St. Andrew which we have related, which occurred in the year
1645; except that this one came alone in the quality of its greatness
(for the shocks that accompanied it were much less severe than in the
former; it is a natural thing to have these earthquakes come with a
retinue, and they are among the evils that can never come singly). The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>second reason why this one was less was based on
the fact that the city of Manila was in a sad condition, and those
lofty edifices of stone were on the ground, which then robbed the city
of much of its pride. Therefore, although some people were killed and
many met with accidents and bodily injury, it was not so bloody.
However it did not fail to exercise its commission, and many edifices
were violently overthrown and great disorder was occasioned not only in
Manila but in all these islands.... Our convent of Santo Domingo was
hardly used; and as the religious had no cells, as those which were
left were full of water, they went along that street seeking corners
where they could stay, even at great inconvenience. When the mission
(of which we shall speak immediately) arrived, lodgings had to be
arranged in the galleries of the new church, where beds and curtains
were distributed among the various collateral naves. A better manner of
lodging could not be found for many days, because the rainy season
(which was a great drawback) had set in. The convent was very fortunate
in having there its superior, who repaired so great a disaster with all
courage and fortitude, and encouraged his subordinates by repairing
their house with great skill and energy, notwithstanding that it was
under heavy expenses. God performed miracles by his hand, and has
continued the same in the other posts which he has held. Truly he is
one of the most careful and indefatigable workers of this holy
province, and as he is yet living, this remark must suffice.</p>
<p class="par">That year arrived an excellent mission which had been
collected in Espa&ntilde;a by father Fray Francisco de la Trinidad, who
had remained there as bishop-elect <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113"

Matheo Bermudez, who conducted it to Mexico, where he remained as vicar
of San Jacinto. The latter entrusted his office to father Fray Juan de
Polanco, who brought that mission safely to Filipinas to the great joy
of all the religious. The mission consisted of thirty-eight,<a class=

of religious who possessed so excellent abilities; they were young, and
well fitted to advance the credit of this holy province. After the
joyful congratulations which welcomed them, they were assigned by the
arrangements of the prelate, then the father commissary, Fray Francisco

Chapter xvii is a summary of the life of father Fray Joseph de Madrid,
who was born in Ceb&uacute;. After studying at Santo Tom&aacute;s in
Manila, he entered the order in that city. He was soon sent to the
Chinese missions, but was unable to remain there on account of the

a violent death at the hands of the Chinese of the

messages of Kuesing in the year 1662. He was a natural linguist,
speaking fluently Ceb&uacute;an, Visayan, Tag&aacute;log, and the
language of Ituy, beside the most difficult dialect of the Chinese,
namely, that spoken about Canton. Chapters xviii and xix treat of the
Chinese pirate Kuesing and Chinese affairs. Chapter xx contains
accounts of the lives of various religious who died in the Dominican
province during this time. Carlos Clemente Gant died in the province of
Nueva Segovia at the age of more than seventy, having arrived in the
Philippines in 1611. He was a native of Zaragoza, and professed in the
same city. His mission field was in the province of Cagayan, whither he
returned both times after his terms as provincial (1637, and 1648). He
also became commissary of the Holy Office after the death of the
commissary Fray Domingo Gonzalez. Joseph de Santa Maria (or Navarro), a
son of the convent of San Pedro Martir at Marchena in Andaluc&iacute;a,
went to the Philippines in 1648. He was vicar of the islands of
Babuyanes, where he fell ill and had to go Lalo-c for treatment; on
returning to his convent he was killed by the insurgents. Pedro de la
Fuente, son of the convent of San Pablo of Burgos, served as lecturer
in theology in the college of Santo Tom&aacute;s in Manila, and regent
and prior of the Manila convent, and was minister in various places in
Cagayan. At his death he was vicar of the village of Pata. The father
commissary, Fray Salvador Mexia, son of the Sevilla convent, went to

Pangasin&aacute;n at the age of more than seventy, being
vicar-provincial of Pangasin&aacute;n. He was a zealous minister, and
left a number of sermons and other pious writings which circulated
among the friars in manuscript. Rafael de la Carcel of the province of
Aragon, a native of Mallorca, who went to the Philippines in 1632, also
died in Pangasin&aacute;n. Among other posts that he held he was prior
of the Manila convent, for a while prior vicar-general, and vicar of
Calasiao. His death occurred soon after the disaffection of that
village, and was probably hastened by that loss. Rodrigo de Cardenas,
bishop of Nueva Segovia, died in May, 1661. He had arrived at the
Philippines in 1653, and held the office of bishop for eight years. He

<p class="par first">The father commissary, Fray Francisco de Paula,
ended his term as provincial, and on April 7, 1661, the father
commissary, Fray Felipe Pardo, then prior of the convent of Santo
Domingo of Manila, was elected in that convent. That was the first time
when he rose to the government of this province as provincial. He
filled that office so well that after twelve years (in 1673) he was
elected for the second time, and is at present in that office. He came
to this province in the mission of 1648, for which he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>left
his convent of San Pablo at Valladolid, where he exercised the office
of master of students. The province always kept him employed here in
the offices of lecturer of morning classes, regent, and rector of the
college of Santo Tomas; president of the hospital, and prior of Manila.
Although he has filled all of them with great credit to his person, and
has been useful and creditable to the order, yet the honor of
commissary of the Holy Inquisition has given him greater
prestige&mdash;both because any service for that holy tribunal (and
especially that of commissary), means so much, and because of the
circumstances of the time. For he was the first commissary elected
after the disturbance, as famous as harmful, which was occasioned in
these islands by the preceding commissary, who arrested the governor at
that time without those orders that he ought to have awaited after
having consulted&mdash;or, more correctly, having informed&mdash;the
holy tribunal of Mexico. The father provincial commenced his first
government with so much spirit and energy that much and even most of it
was left for his second government. For the already-mentioned
insurrection of the Pari&aacute;n happened in his term, as did the
incident of our ambassador,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1144src" href=
"#xd21e1144" name="xd21e1144src">2</a> together with the measures taken
in the offended provinces of the insurgent Indians, although those
provinces are now quiet. In that and in the sending out of missions, in
which he has always manifested his great love and inclination, and in
maintaining them with aid, he could well boast of his great zeal and
capacity&mdash;besides [carrying] the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb120" href="#pb120" name="pb120">120</a>]</span>usual weight [of the
province] which is always heavy. He sent father Fray Jayme Berge (who
came in the mission of the year 1658) to become an associate to father
Fray Victorio Riccio, and ordered father Fray Pedro de Santo Domingo,
who desired it, to come to Manila. At the same time he gave orders and
letters commanding father Fray Juan Polanco, whom the chapter had
appointed definitor for Europa, and procurator-general, to come [to
Manila]. He also conveyed a generous aid to our religious, as well as
what the order of our father St. Francis gave him for their religious.
That did not have the success that was desired, for the greater part
was lost in the conveying of it through that so disturbed country. [The

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The intermediary junta was held in our convent of
Santo Domingo, on April fourteen, one thousand six hundred and
sixty-three. Besides the usual arrangements, no especial thing was
ordained in it except to entrust to the father provincial the printing
of the ritual, and, when that was done, to see that the religious used
it and no other. That is a very important provision, and one in which
the zeal of our superiors is very well occupied, so that our procedure
may be uniform, as we are charged in the beginning of our <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>holy
constitutions. It is not advisable that this matter of ceremonies be
free, since they are so necessary; and piety and opinion have no vote
in this matter, in which the decree of the superiors has explained
their decision. The worst results will follow if neglect occasions it,
since the administration of the holy sacraments is the most essential
point of the ministries; and they need rules and regulations, care in
their study, and punctuality. In the year 1669, a very suitable ritual
was published, which was quite uniform with the Roman ritual of Paul
V....</p>
<p class="par">That year of 1663 our governor, the master-of-camp Don
Diego de Salcedo, came to these islands. He was a worthy soldier of
Flandes, where he had attained honorable posts; and since he had filled
them so well his Majesty entrusted to him the influential post of
captain-general and governor of these islands. If these islands were
three thousand leguas nearer, that office would doubtless not be second
in importance to those of America. The ship put in at Nueva Segovia,
and consequently the said governor came overland&mdash;being received
very hospitably by our ministering religious and those of our father
St. Augustine, who are established along the way. On that journey also
they were received by the natives with feasts, dancing, and music, in
which they are very entertaining. His Lordship gained a good name in
[receiving] those tokens of welcome, inadequate as they were, by the
great affability and generosity that he displayed to the natives. He
reached Manila and assumed his office amid great acclamation and pomp
on the festal day of September eight, the day consecrated to the birth
of the most holy Virgin. That was a great consolation to all people,
and good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>auguries were indicated although not all of them
were fulfilled to the letter. He was beyond doubt a capable man, and
one of great intellect. In but few days he understood whatever
concerned his obligation, and never departed from it so long as it
concerned the king&rsquo;s service. He made the despatches of the ships
to Espa&ntilde;a very punctually, and with foresight; for he recognized
that the ship that left here annually to get the situado is the one
that ought to have the greatest care, and demands activity [in
preparation] so that it may not be pushed for time, but that one or two
months shall be gained. Consequently, there always was a ship [on that
line]; and God took charge of them and brought them in, seeing that
people here were doing their utmost.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1169src" href="#xd21e1169" name="xd21e1169src">3</a> In respect
to the good fortune with which he began [his term], he became
faint-hearted, and cared little for being liked, for that post cannot
be free from cause for harshness. The devil entered, upon seeing the
necessary wall of love somewhat fallen; and he put complaints into the
minds of the traders, which soon spread to the other estates. That
enemy sowed dissension, which is his own seed; and the number of those
disaffected increasing, much opposition to the governor arose. At the
end of the year 1668 (October tenth) the governor was arrested by the
commissary of the Inquisition, Fray Joseph de Paternina, an
Augustinian.... <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123"

The following chapter is devoted to Fray Francisco de Paula, commissary
of the Inquisition and twice provincial, and other fathers. The former
was born in Segovia and took the habit at Salamanca. Enlisting in the
Philippine mission in 1618, on arriving there he began to study Chinese
in the Pari&aacute;n; but was soon transferred to the college of Santo
Tom&aacute;s, where he taught for eighteen years. He was a successful
and eloquent preacher to the Spaniards, and in consequence was elected
preacher-general of the Manila convent. The office of vicar-provincial,
as far as Manila is concerned, was conferred on him; and in the year
1641 he was elected provincial. In 1647, while exercising his duties in
the Manila college of Santo Tom&aacute;s, whither he had returned after
his office had expired, he was elected commissary of the Inquisition.
In 1657 he was again elected provincial. Pedro de Santo Domingo, who
took the habit in Milan, Italy, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124"

1658, at the age of forty, and was sent to the Chinese missions; but,
being unable on account of his age to learn the language, he was sent
back to Manila and became vicar of the convent of Santelmo in Cavite.
Illness, however, pressing on him, he was assigned as vicar to the
Philippine hospice of San Jacinto in Mexico, but died ere reaching his
destination.]</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The capitular members assembled in the year 1665
to elect a provincial, as the father commissary, Fray Felipe Pardo, had
completed his office. On the twenty-fifth of April they elected the
father commissary, Fray Juan de los Angeles, of the province of
Andalucia, and a son of the convent of Santo Domingo del Campo in the
village of Zafra in Estremadura. He had come to this province in the
year 1635, and had been minister of Tagalos in the district of Bataan,
and afterward in the island Hermosa, where he remained six years (the
time when the Dutch captured that fort and drove us from the land). He
returned to Manila by way of Jacatra and Macasar, and to his former
ministry of Tagalos. He was rector of the college of Santo Tomas, twice
prior in our convent of Santo Domingo of Manila, at various times
vicar-general, and definitor in 1661 and 1673. In the year that we
mentioned, the province elected him as its prelate, to the general
satisfaction of all. This is as much as we can say at present, for he
is still living. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125"
name="pb125">125</a>]</span>We can also say that since being
provincial, he has undertaken the charge of the college for boys of San
Juan de Letran. He has provided for them a very suitable and spacious
house within the walls of Manila, that has gained repute and esteem for
the pious education in virtue and the studies of those children, which
is the object [of that college]. This holy province was struggling
manfully at the time of that election, but both hands were busy in
wiping off the tears that were shed before God for two reasons. [The
first reason was the effort of the governor to make the orders publish
the lists of ministries,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1190src" href=
"#xd21e1190" name="xd21e1190src">4</a> as was the custom in the other
parts of the Indias. In 1665 the vessel which arrived brought his
Excellency, Don Fray Juan Lopez, consecrated bishop-elect of
Ceb&uacute;. He brought with him the acts of the general chapter held
in Rome in 1656; the execution of the measures for the government of
the Indias in general were suspended, as the Philippines were not
included in them unless mentioned specially. The second great trouble
of the province was the cruelty practiced on the missionaries in China.

<p class="par first">The bishop Don Fray Juan de Polanco (who was not
yet bishop-elect) went to Espa&ntilde;a with the usual powers conferred
by the province, following Don Fray Juan Lopez, bishop of Zibu and
afterward archbishop of Manila, who had gone the preceding year with
the same powers. But because of accidents, and since the province was
so lacking in religious, a second procurator was despatched. That was
an excellent measure, as the result showed; for the bishop of Zibu was
embarrassed by his new promotion and by his despatches, so that he
could not get the mission ready, although he had made a good start at
it upon the arrival of Don Fray Juan de Polanco. The latter was very
well received in the provinces of Espa&ntilde;a, and all of them showed
him great love and reverence because of the good impression that he
gave by his virtues, which have without doubt the greatest attracting
power for those spiritual soldiers. The commission is one of danger
which only the loftiest object and obedience can make peaceful; for
besides being the sample, as they say, of the cloth, such a person is
not only looked at but spied upon by all; and it is necessary above all
to bear God in mind and keep oneself acceptable to Him for so long and
even almost desperate voyages, so that He may give health in so many
hardships, climates, and paths of the earth, and [enable him to
furnish] a good example for so many different kinds of persons with
whom one must confer and voyage, in the midst of so many cares as he
always has in his charge. The task of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb127" href="#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>making religious is
that of the greatest difficulty; for so long as the men [sought] have
the greatest abilities, their convents, who have reared them, feel it
more, and say farewell to them to see them no more, where natural love
does its duty and the devil is not careless&mdash;although, in fine,
our holy provinces have always nourished this daughter of theirs in the
belief that to give her a religious is to make God careful to send her
many, and to preserve them with the wealth of their virtues. They send
their sons to this honorable warfare, and the latter gain new blasons
for them and get their first share of the spoils in the service of God
and the welfare of souls. Therefore, the procurator who is securing men
needs many lights of virtue, prudence, and affability, and great
patience, for accidents that happen, and for the suitable choice of
routes, and for guidance when they go astray; then the essential part
of presenting the things in his care to the princes, and the
latter&rsquo;s councils and counselors to whose questions he must make
answer with truth and candor. The fear of God is master in all; for, if
he swerve from that line, he cannot make a good voyage. For the other
despatches by tribunals and accountancies, he needs to attend upon them
without being troublesome, and enduring delays, civilities, and
courtesies; for they are ministers of the king and worthy of all
esteem, and he must await his time amid the so many cares entrusted to
them. Just at present we all enjoy the ministry of a perfect procurator
of Filipinas in our venerable bishop Don Fray Juan de Polanco, who must
have been a model of procurators; for by his example and virtue alone,
he found himself freed from all the difficulties that accompany that
honorable office. In <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128"
name="pb128">128</a>]</span>their very beginnings he found them solved
and conquered; and he made the very judges of his causes, and even
those who were opposed to him, his attorneys. This is not imagination
but the pure truth; and there are many witnesses still living now in
the holy city of Roma (where he went as definitor in 1668), and in the
royal court of Madrid&mdash;where he was favored by princes, and
esteemed and respected as an apostolic and holy man in their councils
and tribunals; where he was listened to as a learned orator of this
province; and where his causes were heard with the notable grace that
God gave him wherever he went, and with the highest honor in both the
said courts. The time will come for recounting his life and death, and
then a longer account will be given of his virtues. Suffice it to say
for the present that he collected two famous missions for this holy
province, which he accompanied to Mexico (which is the rough place in
the ascent of the hill), and returned for the third time [to
Espa&ntilde;a] for more soldiers&mdash;[whom he would have brought] had
not the giant footsteps of envious death intercepted him in Sevilla. He
entrusted the first mission to one of its religious, namely, father
Fray Baltasar de Santa Cruz. They reached Manila safely in August,
1666, and their names in order of age are as follows: father Fray Juan

<p class="par">This fine mission came in the ship &ldquo;La
Concepcion,&rdquo; that year of 1666. The same ship also brought
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>two other missions, one of our father, St.
Francis, and the other of the Society of Jesus; two religious of St.
John of God, and secular priests; also captains, and very honorable
persons&mdash;in charge of the commander Joseph de Zamora. The ship was
unable to make the Embocadero because the vendavals which had set in
prevented it. Therefore it was very fortunate in making the port of
Palapa, which is located on the southern side.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1228src" href="#xd21e1228" name="xd21e1228src">6</a> They
anchored there on the day of St. Lawrence, and it was considered a very
special providence of God that they disembarked there on that land, for
all arriving in great need and worn out after four months and more of
continual navigation, they found, especially the religious, that they
had arrived at the land so oft desired and the land of promise. They
found in that village, which is in charge of the fathers of the
Society, a father rector whose charity challenged the needs of all of
them and was victorious. This was the ever venerable father Melchor de
los Reyes, a native of Puerto Rico, who, although very poor in that
ministry of his, yet settled the difficulty as a very rich man. He
lodged eighty religious without even remotely expecting one. He
received them all with the ringing of bells, with playing on wind
instruments, and music. He supported them abundantly and daintily until
boats were found to take them to Manila (which could not be done in a
few days). He also succored the ship with rice and other supplies, and
with dainties, according to their persons. Ours were the best served,
for boats were not found; and although it was thought that the ship
could soon proceed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132"
name="pb132">132</a>]</span>upon its voyage, the bad weather was so
obstinate that it was unable to sail until March of the following year.
Therefore they remained in that holy house with the same satisfaction
that they could have had in the most wealthy convent of our order.
Sufficiently accommodated in those lodgings, they all said mass; and
then those who wished had their breakfast. All the food was supplied
abundantly, with the utmost cleanliness and punctuality. They were
sheltered in the choir and galleries with great quiet. A pleasant and
crystal river flowed near the college, for recreation and bathing.
There were books in great abundance, according to the taste of each
one. Above all was the affability of the holy religious, and of the
others who attended to those residences belonging to their ministry.
Truly there are no words to imagine the consolation that the Lord gave
there to our tired religious, or the obligation under which all this
province remained at so generous charity. The religious who served as
superior of Ours, seeing the length of time that they were staying
there, and the so excessive expense that was being incurred, although
fearful of a bad outcome, finally, to satisfy his ill-founded fear,
took one hundred pesos from the scanty hoard of the mission, and
resolved to give them to the father rector. They were not sufficient
even to cover the cost of the rice, but in the end would be some aid in
meeting the expenses. He followed the rector alone into his apartment,
and, changing color, after some arguments which he endeavored to offer
he concluded by asking pardon, and asked him to please take that trifle
to pay at least the porters and cooks, since our mission was detained
so long there. The father rector assumed a serious countenance then,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>and in brief, sorrowfully proceeded to give the
father a severe reproof, by telling him that nothing worthy of payment
had been done there; that the father vice-provincial had ordered him to
attend to that obligation; that the fathers of his residences had
brought the supplies, each in accordance with his several ability;
that, thanks to God, nothing was owed to the Indians; that God was
giving for everything; and that he rather was the gainer, for, without
knowing how, he found his pantries full; that during those days two
dugongs had been caught (a thing which had not been seen before since
he had been there, for never had those fish been seen there, for it was
by a great miracle). Thus did he minimize all that he had done; but our
religious, still insisting and placing the hundred pesos on the table,
witnessed that the venerable father fell on his knees, and clasping his
hands, with tears in his eyes, said to him: &ldquo;No, no, father, you
must not leave that money here for me. I beg that of you in the name of
the most holy Virgin. She will not permit your Reverence to give me
such affront, at least for the good-will with which I have served
you.&rdquo; Thereupon, the religious begged pardon, and kept his money
without knowing how to pay that debt, unless it be paid in the divine
treasuries of God, for whom it was all done. Our religious went out in
seven bands, and for each band the rector solicited a boat, a good
pilot, and a store of supplies for some days. All came [to Manila]
singing the praises of so religious an Alexander, who was finally
reared in so holy a school as that of the Society of Jesus&mdash;where,
although one is taught all kinds of knowledge so completely, we can say
that charity is that which is not taught, because it is inspired. God
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=
"pb134">134</a>]</span>will now have paid that pious father, for
already has He taken him to himself. The religious consumed two more
months in going from Palapa to Manila because of the bad weather.
However, they passed almost always through ministries belonging to our
father St. Francis, where they found themselves detained and hindered
more by the great love with which they were welcomed, and the regret
with which they were allowed to depart, than by the roads and the
difficulties of travel. They arrived at the desired place at last and
were received by the father provincial, then the father commissary,
Fray Juan de los Angeles, with that paternal love which his natural
affability and his obligation dictated to him. When he saw that they
were rested, he began to assign them occupations.</p>
<p class="par">On September 27 of the former year 1665, our most
reverend father-general, Fray Juan Bautista de Marinis, wrote a loving
and thoughtful letter from Roma to the venerable father Fray Juan
Bautista de Morales. That letter reached the province in 1667, and,
although the father was dead, it will be proper that so precious a
thing&mdash;to the credit of the paternal providence of its author, and
of the reputation that this noble although so retired a member had
gained with the supreme head of the order&mdash;shall not perish or be
lost; and it is also to the credit of this holy province, for they so
hold his name in memory as to honor it through its sons, our supreme
heads. The letter reads as follows: &ldquo;Reverend father in Christ:
Health, and grace from the Holy Ghost. The news that I have received
from the father provincial of that our province of the Filipinas is a
great consolation to me. He gives me news of your Reverence&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=

are aiding in those conversions without any relaxation to your labors
in your so advanced age. I thank the Lord therefor, from whom comes all
good; and applying to your Reverence the sufferings of all the order,
and giving you the benediction of our glorious St. Dominic, I thank you
again and again for having served in our ministry for the conversion of
souls, which is the object of our institute, and which your Reverence
and your companions are, with the divine grace, accomplishing.
Forty-two religious sailed in the mission which left Cadiz on July 5 of
this year, for which the father lecturer, Fray Juan Polanco, procurator
of the province, worked zealously and diligently. The consolation that
I have had in the selection of those missionaries will increase if your
Reverence will take them under your teaching, and encourage and exhort
them so that, as sons of so good a father, they may give bread to those
who, desirous of spiritual sustenance, beg it. May God please that it
be so, for such is my desire. In regard to the labors of government, it
will relieve us to receive letters from your Reverence, and to have
news of the progress of so loving sons as it has been God&rsquo;s
pleasure to give me. I have sent breviaries and a formulary of devotion
to the twelve associates of your Reverence, which is as a token of my
love, so that you may be mindful of me in your prayers, and ask God to
give me the success that I desire in the fulfilment of my obligation. I
am sending to your Reverence documents containing the many thanks that
the holy apostolic see has given us; and I inform you that his Holiness
in our Lord, Alexander VII, who is auspiciously governing this Church,
is granting us very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136"
name="pb136">136</a>]</span>loving favors; and I hope to receive even
greater ones from his munificence. I shall give him an account of the
extensive labors of your Reverence, and of the happiness that we may
expect because an entrance has been made into the island Hermosa,
whence the passage to China and to Japon will be facilitated. May God
continually preserve and accompany your Reverence and all those my
sons&mdash;to whom I say that the cause of the holy martyrs of Japon is
proceeding felicitously;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1243src" href=

of their martyrdom will be a motive to the others, so that, if it
should prove necessary for the maintenance of our holy faith to suffer
as martyrs they may do so with gladness. Roma, September 27, 1665.</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;<span class="sc">Fray Juan Bautista de

<p class="par">This is the letter written ex-officio by the general of
the order to a poor missionary under him, giving place to this care

<p class="par">In the year 1667, on the day of the immaculate
conception of our Lady, December 8, the most illustrious doctor Don
Miguel de Poblete, archbishop of Manila, died in that city, to the
universal sorrow of all these islands; for during the time of fourteen
years while he had occupied the see, he acted as the loving father and
pastor of his church. He was a very amiable <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>man,
pious, and possessed of great charity; for notwithstanding the poverty
of this archbishopric, and its dependence upon the condition of a royal
treasury that is so poor and has so many creditors, he gave liberal
alms, which he took from the sustenance of his own person, his
household, and his family. He was very anxious for the building of his
cathedral, which he found completely ruined since the earthquakes. With
grave importunity and the amount that his Majesty ordered to be paid to
him, he left a church that was very sumptuous (as much so as these
islands permit), almost finished. It has three naves, all of free stone
and rubble-work masonry. It was finished a short time after his death;
and its venerable dean and cabildo occupied it to the great consolation
and credit of the city. On the day of his death occurred the ceremony
of taking the oath of allegiance to the king our sovereign, Carlos
Second;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1260src" href="#xd21e1260" name=
"xd21e1260src">8</a> and God made that occasion propitious for us, for
with that his venerable body, embalmed, was exposed for three days, and
the faithful had time to go with tearful piety to say farewell to their
most loving shepherd, whose hands and feet they kissed until he was
buried with due pomp. It was the common report, and an established
fact, that he died a virgin, and beloved to the utmost degree<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1266src" href="#xd21e1266" name="xd21e1266src">9</a>
for his so beautiful virtue. This and his piety, not at all embarrassed
by personal considerations, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href=
"#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>were sufficient to compose a
palm<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1283src" href="#xd21e1283" name=
"xd21e1283src">10</a> for him; and after it was placed it appeared very
fitting. God will give his fame a special history, as ours cannot go
into greater detail.</p>
<p class="par">In those two years God took from us valuable associates
of long experience, who served this holy province much by their example
and work for the welfare of the Indians. Father Fray Juan de Arjona,
son of the convent of San Pablo el Real in Cordova, [was one]. He had
been occupied with great earnestness in the ministries of Pangasinan
and Ytui, and there he performed great deeds for the service of God, as
those ministries were new. He died at an advanced age in the convent of
Santo Domingo in Manila. Father Fray Juan Pabon, native of Montaruches
in Estremadura, son of the convent at Truxillo in the province of
Espa&ntilde;a, was most accomplished in the language of Nueva Segovia,
and suffered great hardships in the conversion of the Indians of Irraya
and in the administration of other villages. The love and respect of
all who came in contact with him was very great; and the province
entrusted to him many posts of honor, and grieved not a little at his
death, for he was a model for ministers, and in every respect a pattern
of his obligation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139"

<h3 class="main">CHAPTER XLII</h3>
<div class="argument">
<p class="par first"><i>Of the intermediary junta of the year
sixty-seven; and of other news of this period of our
history<span class="corr" id="xd21e1296" title=
"Not in source">.</span></i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On April thirty of the year 1667 was held and
celebrated the intermediary junta [in the term] of the father
commissary Fray Juan de los Angeles, in our convent of Santo Domingo in
Manila&mdash;and with new vigor because of the fervor imparted to the
province by the fresh nourishment received from its late
re&euml;nforcement. They proceeded to arrange the ministries, and one
more which it seemed advisable to separate, namely, San Miguel at
Orion, in the district of Bataan. After knowing the new soldiers for a
year, the old and new stones were assigned to their places in order to
render this spiritual edifice firm and beautiful. The new rules made
were but few, but they were very carefully thought out. The first was
that no inferior or subordinate official of the order should visit or
write to the alcaldes and superiors of the provinces, and least of all
to the governor, without first making known his intention and
explaining it to the father provincial&mdash;or, in his absence, to the
vicars-provincial&mdash;respectively. That was and ought to be a
necessary measure; and the attempt to carry out the decisions that each
minister reaches in his seclusion may be the cause of greater troubles.
We must not make a passion of our zeal for defending the Indians, for
that is a virtue that essentially demands to be moderated by prudence.
An angry letter, or (what is worse) a visit, founded perhaps on a
misrepresentation, generally disquiets a superior. He, in his own
opinion offended, is vexed; and the Indians themselves, and the rest of
the religious, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name=
"pb140">140</a>]</span>are wont to pay doubly [for the intrusion].
Consequently, it is proper that such matters be managed with much
caution and in accordance with obedience, and in the council [of the
order], keeping in view the object, which must be the first aim of
every good intention. Everyone does what he is able in his ministry and
profession, and the apostle says that we should give offense to no one.
The heads of the province, being in an exalted position, discover many
things and efficient remedies for all troubles; and hence it is
necessary to place such affairs in their hands. For the same reason and
one greater, that junta repeats the order that no one should preach
against the government and the persons busied in it without consulting
with the same superiors. For that means consultation with God, because
words are very important in that most lofty and consecrated
place&mdash;where by favor of the sovereign principles of a wisdom
whose master is the fear of God, and general doctrines, one may say
whatever there is to say. Our father San Vicente Ferrer did not preach
more than the judgment, but he reformed the world, kings, and chiefs.
And only a St. John the Baptist, who by credit of his virtue pointed
out with his finger a divine Person, could point out from the pulpit a
person so wicked and scandalous as a Herod; for the latter was, in
fine, king, and his dignity protected him. God placed our superiors in
their positions (and kings rule through God) and gave that honor to
their councils and magistracies; and consequently it is proper for
ministers to honor them without flattery (which is another and worse
extreme) without curing them with salt, and with respect where the
community does not feel it&mdash;so that by preaching to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>people at large, they will know where their pain
is. We have already touched on this point in another place; but, since
our province repeats it so often in its ordinances, the historian is
also permitted to repeat it, since it is advice so important. A
petition was addressed to our most reverend father not to allow
dispensations to be introduced into our provinces, nor anything that
savored of [differences between] individuals or degrees. For since it
had seemed to his paternal piety that the procurators-general who went
from this province to those of Europa had immense work therein, he
planned to grant to them officially some sort of reward, by conferring
on them the rank of the more recent fathers of the province. Receiving
this favor with submission and gratitude, they nevertheless protested
in this junta against it. At the same time Don Fray Juan de Polanco
made a humble resistance in Roma, as he knew that the order had already
been sent. But he obtained that new favor from our most reverend
father; and, before our petition arrived, the said grace was
revoked.</p>
<p class="par">In the following year of 1668 two relief ships reached
these islands, which came from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. In one of them came
father Fray Antonio Calderon, who had obtained permission to return to
Espa&ntilde;a the preceding year, because of illness. But later, as he
regained strength in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and as he knew the lack that
one religious makes here, and the need of the province, he was filled
with no small doubt, seeing that this was coming to be a second
vocation. Therefore, he determined to return, and did so; and entered
the province for the second time with great courage and went to his
ministries in Nueva Segovia, where he is and was an excellent
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>linguist. The devil is very subtile, and,
because he sees the evil that is caused him by this province, he causes
sickness, and makes sufferings greater than what they are in
themselves. Since also the magnanimous nature of man falls short, and
he takes it ill to see himself set in a land like this&mdash;as shut
out from intercourse and repose as contrary to the liberty of our
Espa&ntilde;a&mdash;with the little attention given to him, he imagines
insuperable hardships in the rules, aggravates his sickness in so great
retirement; and by a door that is lawful, he disturbs the common cause
and even endangers that of the individual. The said father now found
himself strong, and consequently chose to return, to exercise his
strength in this his province. In the other ship came father Fray
Arcadio del Rosario, who had, as we have remarked above, remained in
Mexico sick, and was now coming very strong and well&mdash;to a place
where the only consolations and pleasures that went out to meet him
were a peril and sudden catastrophe, which would have been the last had
not God aided him almost miraculously. Because of the difficulty that
the ship had in entering the strait or Embocadero of San
Bernardino&mdash;and those difficulties are very great and usual in
those seas in that season&mdash;the father took a small boat called a
caracoa; and, embarking in it with a father visitor-commissary of our
father St. Francis, who was coming as visitor, and another, his
associate, with rowers and other Spanish passengers, they tried to
cross the strait, in order to continue their course to Manila more
quickly than they could by the ship, if they waited for it. Those boats
are not only swift but weak, and, in order to give them greater safety,
some long timbers are crossed at intervals over the sides; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>at
the ends of these they suitably place some bamboo sails called
<i>cates</i>, so that, by thus making the vessel wider, they may better
resist the waves and sustain them. They were beginning their crossing,
which is a distance of about six leguas, and in the very middle of it
so strong a gust of wind struck them, as well as so opposing
currents&mdash;which, in those regions, are such that they will turn a
ship of high free-board clear around, with or without favorable winds,
moving it from side to side and disarranging the [trim of the] sails,
with the accompanying horror that only sailors can imagine&mdash;that
that boat (for it was not even a patache, but a very weak vessel)
capsized, because of the currents and the violent wind that they
encountered in the midst of the open expanse, after a few contrary
blasts, and filled with water. It was the Lord&rsquo;s will that the
buffeting of the sea should soon strip it of weight, carrying away
whatever it contained. Thereupon the men in it remained astride of the
said timbers and <i>cates</i>, and many of them were up to their
breasts in water, rigging it. In such wise they allowed themselves to
drift along with the said current, wherever it chose to take them,
sustained only on those timbers poorly fastened together with rattan.
Night came; day followed; and in all that time they were unable to make
the land&mdash;on the contrary, the currents carried them away from it.
When they got out of one current they were seized by one opposed to it,
so that they were continually going, round and round in those waters.
Father Fray Arcadio, who was still convalescent, suffered the most; and
doubtless would soon have given up, had it not been for the said father
commissary. A bamboo enclosure was made as well as possible on those
timbers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>and there the father found some retreat from the
water, mainly in the arms of the said father commissary. The
latter&rsquo;s name was Fray Antonio Godinez, son of the religious
province of San Diego in Mexico. With the same suffering did they pass
the following night&mdash;without water to drink in the midst of so
much water, nor more food than a few grains of rice, which the wrath of
so rigorous a fortune that assailed those miserable beings had
forgotten. At last, on the third day, the Lord, as a Father of mercy,
listened to them and they reached the land; where, more beaten by the
waves of the sea than assisted by what the rowers could do, they
reached the sacred sand in a stripped condition. Three men were
drowned, who tried to quit the boat too soon, and the sea made them pay
for their ingratitude with their lives; for their weakness had already
forbidden them [from reaching land]. It is always a rule of sailors
that only wood can swim on such occasions. All is as God ordains; but
already deposit was made of life, and a good account, by means of his
Majesty, must be given. Our religious landed, or rather those who
shared his fortunes drew him ashore half dead. But the land performed
its miracles, and they hastened to the first village, where they all
recovered and were despatched to Manila. The pious commissary lost
there all the papers of his commission, so that, when he reached the
province, great difficulties were raised, and he returned without
making his visit. Father Fray Arcadio reached this our province, where
he was gladly received, and the prelate assigned him to the study of
the Chinese language, in which he took the courses that will be related
at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p class="par">[The provincial receives a letter dated Roma, February
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=

Juan Bautista de Marinis, in which concessions to the order by Pope
Clement IX are related. The beatified Luis Beltran and Mother Rosa de
Santa Maria have been canonized; universal prayer <i lang="la">ad
libitum</i> to San Vicente Ferrer has been conceded; and other
concessions of general importance to the order are granted. August 1,
1673, four religious embark for the Chinese missions&mdash;namely,
Arcadio del Rosario, Pedro de Alcala, Pedro de Alarcon, and Alonso de
Cordova. The rough weather experienced causes the superstitious Chinese
crew to imagine that it is caused by the fathers; but after many
hardships China is finally reached in twenty-four days. After various
adventures they return to Manila, May 4, 1674. Two Dominican religious,
namely, Arcadio del Rosario and Francisco Lujan, and two Franciscans,
namely, Miguel Flores and Pedro de Pi&ntilde;uelo, sail for China on
Corpus Christi day, 1676.]</p>
<p class="par">At the same time, religious are being occupied in two
glorious missions in this same island of Manila. One near the city, to
the north, is to the Zambals, whom we have not yet been able to subdue.
Now two of our religious are there, and are bringing in those of the
mountains to form villages. They possess churches and many of the
people are converted. The religious write that they have been received
very well, and it is hoped that this will be a grand work for the
service of God and for these islands, for those people are very
courageous and bloodthirsty, and have always done great harm to those
who go to other provinces and to the villages near them; and, if the
faith of Christ once subjects them, great advantages present themselves
for all. The other mission is located in the same region, in the
province of Nueva Segovia, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href=
"#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>in the district of the mountains
called Irraya, of which this history has already given repeated
notices. Most of those people are heathen, although there are many
Christians among them who have fled from our villages. They have been
subdued at times, but their misfortune has immediately roused them to
rebellion. Now we are considering how to attract them by love, and with
security; and our religious are moving alone in this matter, with none
of the horrors that soldiers bring. Consequently, we trust that they
too will be subdued. Such is our special vocation in this holy
province, where we profess especially to fight the wars of God. And
thus as the good soldier loses spirit when peace is declared, and is
inspirited at the rumor of a battle, It is an evident fact that these
spiritual soldiers are aroused to unusual ardor when the arms of the
missions are in use, just as the silence of these voices depresses
them. And, if their sufferings and efforts reached at least half as far
as do their desires, there would be no province in Asia now which had
not yielded to God and to His holy faith in accordance with the
honorable designs with which the beautiful sky of these islands
inspires them.</p>

<p class="par">After the archbishop, Don Fray Hernando, had governed
his church of Manila during his time with the troubles and anxiety that
have been mentioned in their proper place, and many others which
afterward continued to exercise his patience and tolerance (which, to
one of his many years, were a great weight to place on him at the end
of his life), he fell sick from various accidents, which prostrated him
in a short time and reduced him to his last illness. This occurred
during his visitation of the village of Balay&aacute;n, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>where he had remained a long time busied in the
confirmations of that entire province. The vigilant prelate was
unwilling to lay aside his bodily labors, as he was by nature very
active. He celebrated mass every day, until his attendant, recognizing
that his illness was becoming aggravated, induced him to retire to
Manila in order to take better care of his health. He reached the city
in the middle of May, where he was shortly prostrated by his illness
which made the physicians think that he was going to end his days very
soon. All the remaining days left to him, he busied himself fervently
in preparing for his last hour, abstracting himself in religious
thought during all the time that either the care of his medicine or the
compliance of his attendants permitted. But, coming to the last pass,
he ordered that all the holy sacraments be given to him. He received
them in public with great fervor, and to the edification of all the
people. The people were very sorry to lose a shepherd so zealous for
the welfare of souls, who had suffered so much to defend the immunity
of the Church. Day and night was his archiepiscopal palace never free
from the religious, who loved him dearly as the defender and protector
of them all. Not less was the sorrow of the cabildo, who loved him as a
true father; for although he had had various conflicts with them, he
was their consolation and defense as well as that of the clergy, among
whom he performed all the offices of love and piety possible. He
succored the poor and sheltered the needy clerics, for he was very
zealous for the honor of the ecclesiastics. Finally, laden with merits
and years, he rendered up his soul to his Creator, July 1, 1641, at one
o&rsquo;clock at night, at the age of more than seventy. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>His
death caused general sorrow to all, especially to those who had borne
most part in the sorrow that that great prelate had experienced.</p>
<p class="par">Don Fray Hernando Guerrero was a native of the town of
Alcaraz, although Doctor Juan P&eacute;rez de Montalb&aacute;n
represents him as born in Madrid. He was the legitimate son of Don
Fernando Guerrero and of Do&ntilde;a Isabel de la Barreta, both of
noble blood. He received the habit of our holy religion in the convent
of San Felipe in Madrid, where he professed July 26, 1588, during the
priorship of father Fray Antonio de Velasco. Later he came to these
islands in the year 1595 with the mission that was sent from
Espa&ntilde;a by father Fray Francisco de Ortega&mdash;who died
afterward in Mexico, when returning as the ambassador of King Don
Felipe II to the emperor of China. He was minister of the provinces of
Tagalos, where he built the convent of Tagui; it was a magnificent work
before it suffered ruin in the earthquakes of 1645, which overthrew the
most sumptuous edifices. He obtained the most honorable posts in the
order next to the provincialate, as a reward for his great merits; and,
had he not been presented by his Majesty as bishop of Nueva Segovia, he
would also have filled the post of provincial. That was due to his many
services to this province; for he went to Espa&ntilde;a twice and
brought over two excellent missions of religious. Special mention is
made of this archbishop by the father master Fray Tom&aacute;s de
Herrera, on folio 243 of the first part of his <i lang="es">Alfabeta
Agustiniano</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;Augustinian Alphabet&rdquo;]; and
on folio 297 of chapter 43 of the first part of the history of our
convent of Salamanca. He is said to have received <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>despatches to act as governor of these islands,
although that is not clear to me. It may be true that he had a decree
to act as governor <i>ad interim</i>; but as there was no vacancy in
the government of these islands, he never had occasion to use that
favor. In a rare book preserved in manuscript in the treasury of the
holy cathedral church of Manila, on the lives and deeds of the
archbishops of the city, there is a very long relation of the
government of Don Fray Hernando Guerrero and of his great sufferings in
defense of the ecclesiastical immunity. Speaking of his death, the
following is added:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;His death was greatly regretted, for the poor
loved him dearly for the many great alms that he gave them both
publicly and in secret. The rich esteemed him, for, besides his being
very courteous and kind, they never gave him anything, however little,
that was not recompensed with something greater. The orders venerated
him, because the delicacy with which he gained the good-will of all was
extreme; and he obtained that by his paternal affection and affability.
Although his cabildo showed him little kindness, he did not for that
reason cease to esteem them. He succored the poor presbyters and the
clergy by giving them alms sufficient to clothe themselves; for he
sorrowed excessively at seeing that they did not have the proper
vestments. He bought them bits of silk and <i>chanl&eacute;s</i> for
cassocks and cloaks, so that they might appear properly. He bought some
houses, very elegant in their time, on the square of this city, and
fitted them up for the archiepiscopal palace; but, as his debts were so
heavy that he could not pay for them, they were bought after his death

the gospel side. He ruled that archbishopric for five years, eleven
months, and nine days. He was grave of aspect and spare in figure, of
good proportion and stature, somewhat bald and hair somewhat curly. He
was temperate in his eating, indeed eating very little. He spent much
time in vigils. In his conversation he was very affable. He slept on
the ground, the bed that he had&mdash;well furnished with handsome
coverlets, on account of his dignity&mdash;remaining untouched. In
short, he was in all things a perfect prelate.&rdquo;...</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Father Fray Ger&oacute;nimo de Medrano had
governed this province with great success during his second triennium,
and all were sorry when his term ended, and were desirous to have his
life last so that he might be elected for the third time, as happened
after in the year 1650; for that religious, who was so worthy of that
office, left a great memory to posterity of his exalted virtue and
prudence. Thus, the time prescribed by our holy rules having arrived,
the provincial chapter of this province was celebrated April 16, 1644,
in the convent of San Pablo at Manila. Father Master Fray
Te&oacute;filo Mascar&oacute;s presided at that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>chapter by the letters-patent of our very
reverend father master, Fray Hip&oacute;lito de Monte-final, general of
all our holy order. Master Fray Alonso Carvajal, the oracle of these
islands at that time, was elected provincial. The definitors were
fathers Fray Alonso de Lara,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1470src" href=
"#xd21e1470" name="xd21e1470src">1</a> Fray Antonio Gimenez, Fray
Crist&oacute;bal de Le&oacute;n,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1476src"

Quijano.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1482src" href="#xd21e1482" name=
"xd21e1482src">3</a> The visitors were fathers Fray Juan Gallegos, and
the lecturer was Fray Diego de Ochoa.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1488src" href="#xd21e1488" name="xd21e1488src">4</a></p>
<p class="par">In the ship that came from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a that
year, came as governor Don Diego Fajardo Chac&oacute;n, knight of the
Order of Santiago, an illustrious scion of the house of the
Marqu&eacute;s de los Velez, and nephew of Governor Don Alonso Fajardo
y Tenza. That gentleman had been reared in the family of the most
serene prince, Manuel Filiberto, the duke of Saboya, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>whose captain of the guard he had been.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1498src" href="#xd21e1498" name="xd21e1498src">5</a>
Later by various promotions acquired by his valor in war, he came to be
governor of Perpi&ntilde;&aacute;n and afterward of the Terceras
Islands. He was a gentleman of great abilities, which, had they not
been accompanied by an excessive severity, uncommunicativeness, and too
great rigor in his punishments, would have rendered him equal to the
greatest governors, not only of these islands but of the whole world.
For he was very intelligent in military affairs, but chaste, truthful,
and modest, and so free from anything that can touch covetousness that
in that respect he rather resembled a most observant religious than a
military gentleman; for he was never known and he never presumed to
receive anything&mdash;not only no jewel of value, but not even a
present of any food. He began to govern August 16 and remained nine
years in the government, during which the citizens suffered many
misfortunes and many annoyances; for that so upright and honorable
gentleman, having surrendered to the dictum of one single private
individual, an oldtime citizen of Manila, disappointed the many pledges
that the post of governor has a right to claim. As soon as he assumed
the government, he moved the Pari&aacute;n of the Sangleys to its
present site. It had no greater accommodations than before, but he was
ordered to do so by a royal decree. He ordered that a considerable sum
which the governors received from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158"
href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>the gains of the Sangleys in
gambling be placed in the treasury. Those are the most sinful receipts
that are deposited in the royal treasury in these islands, and the
cause, to the sorrow of many, of the little benefit arising from the
many sums that enter by other channels this public treasury of
Filipinas. That sinful practice thus introduced, lasted a considerable
time, the selfish interest of the very persons who should have checked
this evil causing them to ignore the many difficulties [resulting from
it], until his Majesty Don Felipe V ordered those [gambling] games to
be suppressed, because of the report of the archbishop, Don Diego
Camacho y Avila. In the residencia of his predecessor, Don
Sebasti&aacute;n Hurtado de Corcuera, Don Diego Fajardo conducted
himself so uprightly that because of the charges that resulted from it,
he imprisoned the former in the redoubt of Santiago for five years,
until order was sent by his Majesty to send Don Sebasti&aacute;n to
Espa&ntilde;a, which was done.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1506src"
href="#xd21e1506" name="xd21e1506src">6</a></p>
<p class="par">The ship that sailed for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a that year
put back, after having suffered great storms, thus commencing the
disasters and hardships that have followed during these latter years.
The ship &ldquo;San Diego&rdquo; also put back to Cavite, because the
Dutch enemy had entered the Embocadero of San
Bernardino&mdash;returning to Cavite, where it served as a great
defense against the Dutch in the year 1647, as will be seen. The
threats of the coming of the Dutch were <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>heard continually;
and we in the islands were very anxious because of their new proximity
in the island of Hermosa, a suitable way-station for any purpose. As
was learned later by advices from Jacatra in the former year 1643, they
had been waiting the ships from Acapulco in the Embocadero of San
Bernardino, until they could not withstand the violent storms of that
year. All their plans were to descend upon Manila and drive the
Spaniards from this archipelago. A double re&euml;nforcement of men had
been sent from Holanda for that purpose, and a greater number of small
vessels, besides the two hundred ships with high freeboard that they
had in these seas, scattered from the cape of Buena Esperanza to the
island Hermosa. Although forewarned for any of these things that might
happen, Don Diego Fajardo began to do less than he ought; for he kept
himself in seclusion the greater part of the time, and would not give
that personal attention to the management of affairs which a government
so extensive demanded. That was given to the charge of a private
individual, to whom he had given the management of everything to suit
himself; and that was the cause of great misfortunes. For the first
undertaking was to place the necessary boats in the shipyard; and thus,
when the occasion arrived, there was so scanty forces collected that
the happy success of our arms gainst the Dutch was clearly a
miracle.</p>
<p class="par">One of the first precautions was to send Don Francisco
de Atienza y B&aacute;&ntilde;ez, a native of Toledo and a soldier of
excellent judgment, as governor to Zamboanga, so that he might by his
prudence procure a settled peace with the Mindanaos&mdash;who, being
domestic enemies, had greatly diverted the Spanish <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>arms
in curtailing their pride. A peace was easily obtained with the Moro
king, Corralat, for he had been greatly frightened by the past
successes of the Spaniards. The forts of Jol&oacute; were in great part
occupied by soldiers, but the batteries were not in condition to be
deserted, for it was presumed that the Dutch were about to assault
them&mdash;as happened afterward in June of the year 1648, although
with less benefit than they believed they would have in the beginning.
Consequently, it was necessary to preserve them on that occasion,
although peace had been obtained in the year 1646 with their natives by
means of the same Captain Don Francisco de Atienza. Thus the Spanish
arms were somewhat more free for anything that might happen. However,
when the Moros afterward beheld us involved in greater anxiety with our
defense against the Dutch (who were so hostile to us during the years
of 1646 and 47), they began again to invade the islands with their
piratical raids, and infested the province of Pintados, where they
pillaged and captured.</p>
<p class="par">[In 1645 occurred the death of the prominent
Augustinian, Pedro de Arce, who had arrived in the Philippines shortly
after 1580 in a mission brought by Andr&eacute;s de Aguirre. The

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The year 1645 was disastrous for these
islands&mdash;so much so, that to this day the misfortunes with which
that year ended are bewailed; and together with that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>the
beauty of the edifices that made Manila celebrated among the most
sightly cities, as its ruins, the shapeless skeleton of its beauty,
proclaim it at present. The origin of those misfortunes is reserved
alone for the divine judgment, but much could be conjectured if one saw
the hold that vices had taken on this community. However, let us
venerate the divine decrees, and not examine the secrets of His divine
justice.</p>
<p class="par">The two ships &ldquo;Encarnaci&oacute;n&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Rosario,&rdquo; which were expected from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a
that year with the re&euml;nforcements, arrived as by a miracle in
July. The flagship anchored at the port of Lamp&oacute;n after having
escaped three Dutch warships which had sailed from the Hermosa Island
to take that prize. In order to assure their enterprise, they were
strung out from the cape of Espiritu Santo to the Embocadero of San
Bernardino. But the divine Mercy willed that they were not to obtain
their evil purpose, for our ships did not sight the cape. By means of
some advices which the alcalde-mayor of Leite sent in light vessels,
the flagship received notice and deflected its voyage to Lamp&oacute;n.
Some say that it discovered one of the hostile ships near Palapag, and
believing that some Spanish ships had come from Cavite to escort them,
the ship held on its course to the Embocadero. The Dutch ship pursued
it, by which Crist&oacute;bal M&aacute;rquez de Valenzuela, who was
commander of the vessel, recognized them as enemies and prepared to
fight. The Dutch ship overtook them and fired a piece to make them
lower sail and surrender. Crist&oacute;bal M&aacute;rquez having seen
that, and that there was no other recourse, waited until the enemy was
nearer, when he fired some pieces at it&mdash;with so great accuracy
that the Dutch vessel considered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162"
href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>itself too weak to prosecute
that undertaking alone, and retired. Our flagship continued its
fortunate voyage to Lampon.</p>
<p class="par">The Dutch left that position with the purpose of
assembling all three ships together. During that time and ten days
later, came the almiranta, ignorant of what had happened. Having met an
advice-boat of the alcalde of Leite, which communicated the fact that
the Dutch enemy was in the Embocadero of San Bernardino waiting to
catch them, the almiranta put in at Palapag, and both galleons were
saved as by a miracle. Doctor Don Fernando Montero came to these
islands in the said flagship. He was a native of Burgos and the
consecrated archbishop of Manila; he was a man of great learning, and
one celebrated as an eminent preacher. He had been a preacher to his
Majesty, and, while he was exercising the honored post of chief
chaplain of the royal discalced nuns of Madrid, he was given
appointment as bishop of Nueva Segovia; but while in Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, already consecrated and about to embark, his promotion
to the archbishopric of Manila arrived. But God did not permit Manila
to gain so great a prelate, for he died suddenly in the village of
Pila, located on the lake of Bay, when they were awaiting in Manila to
receive him with triumphal procession. His dead body arrived, and was
brought in by the same gate whence his predecessor, Don Fray Hernando
Guerrero, had gone in exile; and this occurred on the same day of
Thursday, and in the same month and at the same hour, exactly nine
years after that tragedy, which is still so greatly bewailed. Thus the
chimes, which were expected to be joyful, were changed into sadness
twice over, and all the preparation became <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>gloom. The church of Manila was widowed for
eight years more, until the year 1653, when Archbishop Don Miguel de
Poblete entered. They buried Archbishop Don Fernando Montero in the
cathedral, above the steps of the high altar, at the side of Archbishop
Don Fray Miguel de Benavides.</p>
<p class="par">A band of fourteen religious arrived at this province
that year. They had been conducted by the father lecturer, Fray Pedro

virtue, and a man of the first magnitude; and one could write many
chapters of his marvelous life, his austere penitence, his continual
prayer, and his extraordinary death. I feel great sorrow that the
sequence of time cannot be anticipated so that somewhat of the great
favors that God gave to that grand servant of His during this life can
be published. During his life he was the wonder of all who had known
him in the years of his youth, when he was more given to the pastimes
of the world and the vigor of youth, before God called him to the
austerity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=

for ten years constantly until his death. That event was hastened by
the austere penance which he continued until it came. God took him to
himself in the forty-sixth year of his age, June 26, 1667, he himself
having pointed out beforehand the day and hour of his happy
transition.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The father master Fray Alonso de Carvajal governed
this province during his triennium with general acceptation and credit,
and he increased the regular observance there by example rather than
rigor. The time having arrived for the new provincial chapter, it was
held in the convent of San Pablo in Manila, May eleven, one thousand
six hundred and forty-seven. Father Fray Alonso de Lara, senior
definitor of the preceding triennium, presided, as no letters-patent
had been received from our most reverend father-general to enable any
one else to preside. Father Fray Diego de Ord&aacute;s was elected
provincial with the greatest harmony, by the fathers voting. He had
been a minister for many years in the province of Bisayas, and had come
to these islands in the year 1624. In the year 1635 he had brought a
fine mission of religious, as we saw in its proper place. The
definitors <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=

Martin Garc&iacute;a<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1610src" href=
"#xd21e1610" name="xd21e1610src">13</a> was chosen procurator-general
in Espa&ntilde;a, and definitor of this province for the general
chapter of the near future. He was given the authority to appoint a
discreto. It was determined to buy a hospice in M&eacute;jico for the
care of the religious who come to these islands on the missions that
are conducted from Espa&ntilde;a. But that was not put into execution
until many years after, when father Fray Juan de Borja<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1616src" href="#xd21e1616" name=
"xd21e1616src">14</a> obtained it by buying some houses which belonged
to Onofre de Lorenzana along the highway of Tacuba, where the hospice
is located at present. Neither did the embarcation of father Fray
Mart&iacute;n Garc&iacute;a take place, because the Dutch fleet was in
the Embocadero of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167"
name="pb167">167</a>]</span>San Bernardino, waiting both for the
galleon from Espa&ntilde;a and for the one about to sail from Cavite
for the port of Acapulco. For the same reason the provincial was given
dispensation so that he was not required to go to visit the Bisayan
provinces, in order that he might avoid the same danger.</p>
<p class="par">[The troubles with the Dutch in the year 1647 follow.
They are sufficiently treated in <span class="sc">VOL. XXXVI</span>.
Diaz adds:]</p>
<p class="par">This was the last exploit of the Dutch enemy in these
islands, which they had infested for many years with extraordinary
pertinacity. It may be that, tired of the little benefit that they
secured from their hostilities, and affrighted by the vast expenses
caused by the equipment of so many fleets and by the many men that they
lost, they were undeceived in thinking that the defense of these
islands does not rest with divine Providence, which preserves them more
by miracles than by human force.</p>
<p class="par">The rebel Dutch arms derived no better success in the
undertakings that they had attempted during those times in Jol&oacute;
and Zamboanga, guided by the chief Salicala (who was hostile to the
Spaniards), and bribed by a rich present of amber and pearls so that,
the Joloans being protected by their favor, the Dutch could take
Jol&oacute; as their own, and the Joloans would not try to look for a
better opportunity for safety. The Dutch sent two well armed
war-galleons from Batavia, so that they might have more than enough
forces to oppose the few Spanish forces of whom Salicala had informed
them. They reached Jol&oacute; in the middle of July, 1648, and after
having dug <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>their trenches they demanded the surrender of
the place from the sargento-mayor, Esteban de Orella Ugalde, a brave
Biscayan, who was governing that fort. He was given a limit of four
hours, but he replied with so great valor, showing his intention to
defend the fort, that the Dutch began to bombard it with three pieces
of artillery, on the twenty-seventh of the said month. Our fortress,
although small, played its artillery too, so successfully that many of
the Dutchmen were killed, and among them the admiral of the expedition.
The bombardment lasted for three days, but their shots were unable to
demolish our forts, although these were so weak that our men afterward
destroyed them with clubs. The Joloan Moros, seeing the lack of
advantage gained by their allies, grew mistrustful of their patronage;
and the Dutch withdrew, tired and angry. The peace made by Don
Francisco de Atienza with the king of Jolo followed that attack; and on
that pretext the fort was demolished and the Spaniards retired, as it
was a useless undertaking and one of no advantage.</p>
<p class="par">The Dutch greatly regretted the peace made between the
Joloans and the Spaniards; for they had already prepared for that
undertaking, and for the attack on Zamboanga seven of the strongest
galleons armed with picked men and many munitions of war. In order not
to lose so great reputation, they went to attack Zamboanga, where Don
Francisco de Atienza, a brave Toledoan, was governing; and they
remained in sight of the channel, in order to await the relief-boats
for Ternate, which were returning to Manila in charge of General Juan
de Chaves. But, having had contrary storms, those vessels arrived so
late that the Dutch had set sail eleven days before, in despair
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>of succeeding in the undertaking. Before
leaving, the enemy tried to land men in Zamboanga; but our artillery
did them so much damage that they retired to the port of La Caldera.
Captain Pedro Dur&aacute;n Monforte followed them on land with fifty
Spaniards and many Pampangos, in order to prevent them from
disembarking; and the enemy, therefore, contented themselves by
destroying with their cannon the hills, on which they wasted more than
600 balls. They thought that their opponents&rsquo; camp would be quite
demolished by that; and they assured themselves by landing their small
boats with some experienced men. But our men received them so
spiritedly that they made the Dutch retire to their ships, whence they
returned twice with new re&euml;nforcements. But all of them were
driven back with like slaughter, until they gave over their obstinacy,
and sought the shelter of their galleons with the loss of a hundred
men; while our men suffered no other loss in this encounter than a
single man killed when Zamboanga was bombarded&mdash;namely, Captain
Don Luis de Rojas, whose head was carried away by a cannon-ball. The
Dutch, despairing of being able to come out of the matter with credit,
retired to the port of La Caldera, and returned thence to Batavia
thoroughly scared.</p>
<p class="par">Pitiful was the disaster that befell the father
definitor, Fray Pedro de Valenzuela, in the year 1648. Our father
provincial, Fray Diego de Ord&aacute;s, had entrusted to him the annual
visitation of the province of Ilocos. If one goes there by land, he
must inevitably pass through a stretch of unsettled country for a
day&rsquo;s journey, between the province of Pampanga and that of
Pangasin&aacute;n, from the village of Magalang to that of Malunguey.
One cannot pass <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170"
name="pb170">170</a>]</span>it with security without an escort of
Zambals, who are, like the Pampangos of those elevated villages in that
province, a brave people. The reason is, that all that unsettled
portion is exposed to the incursions of the blacks from the mountains
of Playa Honda, who are the cruelest of all that scattered nation.</p>
<p class="par">Those blacks are the ancient inhabitants of this island
of Luz&oacute;n, which is the chief and largest island where Manila is
established; for the other nations of the Indians are lately come from
the adjacent islands of Borney and Sumatra. They are not so black as
those of Africa, but have a color much clearer, although they are alike
in their curly hair. That race is especially wretched and unfortunate,
and cowardly and treacherous. They live in the mountains like wild
beasts, naked, and without villages or houses. They wander about
continually, and sleep on the ground in the open, or in the hollow of
some great tree. Their best shelter is formed of some leaves hastily
arranged. They excel in hunting, for deer, wild boars, buffaloes, and
mountain carabaos abound in these mountains. Their arms are the bow and
arrow, in which they are very skilful. Their paganism almost amounts to
atheism, for they have no idols or sacrifices, but only some vain
superstitions&mdash;in which they are so tenacious and blind that if
any of them would become a true Christian it would be regarded as a
miracle. They are so fond of that manner of living (in which they are
not at all different from the brutes) that not only do they not desire
to live in settlements like men, but some of them who have been reared
from childhood in Manila and other places, run away, and return to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>wretchedness of that life when they are grown,
and to their nakedness and poverty.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1664src"
href="#xd21e1664" name="xd21e1664src">15</a>...</p>
<p class="par">Among the evil inclinations of those unfortunate
creatures, the greatest is a ravenous appetite for killing people and
cutting off their heads&mdash;first of their enemies, but even of their
friends and relatives&mdash;and that for very slight cause. That
cruelty is for them honor, nobility, and estimation. But it is a
greater glory to cut off the head of a Spaniard; and, after performing
their dances and superstitions before it, they use the skull as a
drinking vessel in their greatest feasts.</p>
<p class="par">The father definitor, Fray Pedro de Valenzuela, found
himself among those barbarous people in the most dangerous part of that
wild region, which is a site called Puntal&oacute;n&mdash;a precipice
between hills. He refused to take an escort, for he was overconfident;
and thus he paid for his carelessness by being shot through with many
arrows. Those people cut off his head, which became the occasion of
great banquets, dances, and revels. But all the blacks concerned in
that act of treachery were overtaken very <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>soon by the
punishment of heaven; for they all caught a disease which is called
that of St. Lazarus [<i>i.e.</i>, leprosy]....</p>
<p class="par">That horrible disease has been inherited by their
descendants, and the blacks recognize and confess that it is their
punishment for the murder of Fray Pedro Valenzuela. From that time,
they have not dared to kill any priest; but they only rob them of what
they carry. In my time, a religious of St. John of God was able to
escape death among those blacks by uncovering his tonsure while passing
that dangerous and unsettled district.</p>
<p class="par">Some years later, the same blacks killed General Don
Felipe de Ugalde, a brave Biscayan, in the same place, because he
trusted in his great valor. But the number of the enemy was greater,
and they drove so many arrows through him that he bled to death, after
he had first killed many of the blacks. They cut off his head, which
they held in high esteem as a trophy of such a victory, until it was
possible to ransom it and bury it with ecclesiastical rites. Many other
Spaniards have been killed by their carelessness and great confidence;
and consequently, that unsettled stretch is very dangerous.</p>

<h3 class="main">CHAPTER VIII</h3>
<div class="argument">
<p class="par first"><i>Events of those times, and the provincial
chapter of the year 1650. The insurrection of the Indians of Palapag,
and their pacification.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">That whole triennium was very happy for our
province, because of the prudent government of our father, Fray Diego
de Ord&aacute;s, who was one of the most perfect religious that it has
ever had. He was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173"
name="pb173">173</a>]</span>very observant in the rules of the order,
and zealous for the welfare of the souls of the natives; and he had
been an excellent evangelical minister in the Bisayan provinces of
Panay, Ogtong, and Ceb&uacute;. He was very mild toward his subjects,
but very austere toward himself. If it were not my purpose in writing
this history not to be prolix in writing the lives of the religious, in
order not to expose myself to the belief that I dwell on my own order
too much, the life of our father Fray Diego de Ord&aacute;s would
furnish sufficient material for several chapters. Those who had to do
with him told me much of his continual penitence and prayer, and
especially of his poverty and disinterestedness in temporal affairs,
for which he was notable. His presence in the choir in his extreme old
age was the admiration of the youngest and most robust. Consequently,
he was always venerated by all this province as a father. He was also
much esteemed by the other orders, and by the entire community of
Manila.</p>
<p class="par">But very different was the condition of this community
during all the term of the government of Diego Fajardo until the year
1653, because of the calamities and troubles which occasioned the
earthquake on St. Andrew&rsquo;s day in the former year of 1645, and
because of the frequent comings of the Dutch. And although the divine
Mercy willed to humble their pride by giving us miraculous victories,
yet the anxiety and expenses were very great; and the burden of the
provinces was increased greatly, because of the cutting of timber for
the building of ships and galleys, and other precautions that had to be
taken for defense. But the greatest horror suffered by the community of
Manila was the internal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href=
"#pb174" name="pb174">174</a>]</span>war of fears and sudden surprises,
of imprisonment, embargoes, and exiles, which were continually
occurring, and were such that they exceeded past troubles.</p>
<p class="par">Don Diego Fajardo was a gentleman of great valor and
integrity, and wholly disinterested and free from
covetousness&mdash;qualities that would have been sufficient to have
made him a great governor, had it not been for the counterweight of
other peculiarities that rendered them abortive. For he secluded
himself so much that it became difficult to hold <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1704" title="Source: cummunication">communication</span> with
him, and he was very much feared; from this it resulted that he was so
rigorous in the observance of justice that he would not allow mercy any
play, as if the two virtues were opposed to each other. That natural
fondness for retirement, injurious to so extensive a government as is
that of these islands, forced him to admit an associate for his
negotiations, which is always a dangerous thing in worldly affairs.
Consequently, among those few who gained his good-will, a rich citizen
of Manila well related by marriage gained great control over him. That
man became so much the master of the governor&rsquo;s actions that the
latter neither did nor commanded other than what his favorite desired.
Since this name is given by the world to the tyrants of the wills of
princes, therefore I have desired to suppress the name of that man for
the sake of his honored posterity; for, although it will be indelible
in these islands, it may be at least somewhat unknown outside
them.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1707src" href="#xd21e1707" name=
"xd21e1707src">16</a></p>
<p class="par">The disposition of that favorite was very ambitious
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>and proud, which greatly resembled that of the
harsh and austere governor. Consequently, that sympathy [in
characteristics] conciliated the will of the governor to such an extent
that he gave the favorite complete control of the
government&mdash;giving him more confidence than he ought, in order to
sink farther into his natural retirement. He decreed what this man
ordered to him, and executed only what was directed by the
favorite&rsquo;s influence. Thereupon the latter began with that
license to avenge certain passions and arrogated to himself all the
grandeur, fear, and respect which was due only to the supreme character
of the governor. Master Don Jos&eacute; de Poblete,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1720src" href="#xd21e1720" name="xd21e1720src">17</a> who died
as bishop-elect of Nueva Segovia, wrote a printed relation at the order
of the supreme Council of the Indias, and in accordance with a decree
of his Majesty Don Felipe V, of happy memory, in which his Majesty
ordered that an exact relation be given of the condition of those
islands, in order that he might give notice to his chronicler-general,
Don Tom&aacute;s Tamayo de Vargas, for the general history of the
islands which he was composing; therein he uses these words, when
describing the condition of Manila at that time:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;But although the decrease of wealth and the
general poverty had afflicted this kingdom, accustomed at other times
to great opulence and affluence in all things, yet that which most
grieved the minds of its inhabitants were the acts of violence,
imprisonments, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>embargoes, exiles, and other terrifying
exhibitions of rigor which began to be introduced into it after the
year forty-four, as will be told later. All this, being yet in its
violent beginnings, kept not only this city of Manila, where the
thunderbolts strike nearer, but all the islands of its jurisdiction,
full of horror and gloom; and there was no chink that was not closed to
consolation, when all gates were seen opened to misfortune.&rdquo; The
author of this relation, after having described the earthquake which
happened in the year 1645, proceeds as follows:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;All those plagues, penalties, and wretchedness
above mentioned were not the most grievous matters that afflicted this
community. Worse were the domestic afflictions and secret tragedies
that it suffered during these last years. Those were the hidden pest
that infected men&rsquo;s hearts and poisoned the blood, which instead
of giving vital strength to the members caused them mortal shocks.
These were the slow fever, which, insidiously taking possession of the
principal part of the body, destroyed the harmony of its actions and
disturbed its powers. With the progress of that disease, the hourglass
was so disordered that there was no hour for clemency and fortune, and
all times were given over to misfortune. Already so great was the
number of those thrown into prisons, dungeons, and obscure cells, that
all the places set aside by justice for the punishment of criminals
were filled; and other new and frightful places, sites, and methods of
delayed punishment were found inside the city. And when those places
were also full, it was necessary to divide the prisoners among the
provinces, villages, and presidios of these islands.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name=
"pb177">177</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Thus far Don Jos&eacute; Mill&aacute;n de Poblete, in
the above-cited relation, which was dedicated to the Conde de
Pe&ntilde;aranda, president of the supreme Council of the Indias. In
matters so criminal and full of grief, I have not been willing to trust
to my own poor wit and lack of polish, nor to leave my reputation to
the judgment of others. The worst is, that those disasters continued
with greater rigor to the year one thousand six hundred and
fifty-three.</p>
<p class="par">Those misfortunes were succeeded by another, causing
universal sorrow and pain, namely, the disastrous loss of the ship
&ldquo;Encarnaci&oacute;n,&rdquo; which was returning from Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a laden with very great wealth belonging to the citizens of
Manila. It sighted the land of Filipinas late, and, very severe
vendavals having seized it, it was driven ashore on a beach of the
island of Leite called Bula. Striking through carelessness on a shoal,
a storm overtook the ship, which made kindling-wood of it, although it
had been already lightened of much of its cargo, and all the money was
taken out. Afterward the artillery was taken ashore, and much of the
iron in its construction was used. But the loss of that galleon was
great, because our lack of ships kept these islands threatened by the
frequent coming of the Dutch enemy&mdash;who, protected by their
nearness in the island Hermosa, lost no opportunity to do us all the
harm possible. That misfortune was followed the next year by the
putting back to port of the galleon &ldquo;San Diego,&rdquo; which was
badly injured by the storms that it had suffered in northern latitudes
in the month of October&mdash;which is the most dangerous month for
navigators in all seas.</p>
<p class="par">The three years of the prudent government of our
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>father, Fray Diego de Ord&aacute;s, having been
concluded&mdash;to the general sorrow of this province, which was
desirous to re&euml;lect him for the second time, and oftener if
possible&mdash;the fathers who had a vote assembled in chapter in the
convent of Manila, May nine, 1650, and elected as provincial for the
third time our father Fray Ger&oacute;nimo de Medrano. The senior
definitor, Fray Ger&oacute;nimo de Paredes, presided. As new definitors
were elected fathers Fray Lucas de Aguilar,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1741src" href="#xd21e1741" name="xd21e1741src">18</a> Fray Sancho
de Moncada,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1747src" href="#xd21e1747" name=

id="xd21e1753src" href="#xd21e1753" name="xd21e1753src">20</a> and Fray
Diego Tamayo. The visitors were Fray Pedro Mej&iacute;a and Fray
Tom&aacute;s de Villanueva. Fraternal relations between our order and
the fathers of the Society were settled at that chapter, and the feasts
of the two holy patriarchs were celebrated alternately. It was
accomplished by Ours saying mass on St. Ignatius&rsquo;s day, while the
same was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>done by the fathers of the Society in our
convent&mdash;they preaching and celebrating mass on the day of our
father, St. Augustine. That holy concord and harmony lasted for several
years, until the enemy of the peace destroyed it.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1762src" href="#xd21e1762" name="xd21e1762src">21</a></p>
<p class="par">As the father-procurator, Fray Mart&iacute;n
Garc&iacute;a, had died on the voyage, father Fray Juan
Lozano,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1771src" href="#xd21e1771" name=
"xd21e1771src">22</a> apostolic missionary in the Bisayan
provinces&mdash;where the memory of his great virtue, acts of penance,
and contemplation still lasted when I went to the said provinces in the
year 1671&mdash;was appointed in that chapter meeting. But that
appointment failed to go through; for the father-procurator did not
embark, as he was prevented by Governor Don Diego Fajardo&mdash;or
rather, by his favorite who was governing; for the latter feared that
he was carrying reports denouncing his operations, which had thrown
those islands into the final degree of consternation. Accordingly,
father Fray Crist&oacute;bal Enriquez was appointed, and he sailed that
year. However, in the year 1652 they succeeded in sending father Fray
Juan Lozano as procurator to bring some religious, even if it should be
from the provinces of M&eacute;jico and Mechoac&aacute;n, for the need
that we were suffering was very urgent; but he died on the way to
Acapulco. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href="#pb180" name=
"pb180">180</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Our father Fray Diego de Ord&aacute;s presented a
petition to the definitorio, yielding and renouncing the right that he
held according to our rules, as immediate outgoing provincial, to be
able to assume the government of the province in case of the death of
the recently-elected provincial, who was very aged. That resignation
was accepted in order to console him and because of the many entreaties
therefor which he proffered. All the fathers were edified at beholding
him so free from ambition, although they forced him in the following
chapter to receive the office of provincial, which he accepted very
reluctantly.</p>
<p class="par">Since the pacification of the insurrection of the
Indians of Palapag (in the province of Leite) in Pintados was finished
in that year of one thousand six hundred and fifty, I shall here insert
some notice of that insurrection, leaving the historians of the Society
of Jesus to deal with it more particularly&mdash;who as they were
eyewitnesses of it, will have more individual information about its
events. [Diaz&rsquo;s account of this insurrection will appear in
another place.]</p>
<p class="par">Another very considerable misfortune happened at that
time, namely, the loss of the galleon &ldquo;Encarnaci&oacute;n,&rdquo;
under command of General Don L&oacute;pez Col&iacute;ndrico. It was
broken to pieces at a place called Bal&oacute;n, because it left
Acapulco late, and because, having lost the better season of the
brisas, the favorable winds, ran aground at Bagambog, on the coast of
Caraga in the island of Mindanao&mdash;a place where no ship had passed
since the year 1542, when General Ruy L&oacute;pez de Villalobos
anchored there with his fleet. The governor sent orders to

<p class="par first">[Manila had been in distress for some years
because of the loss of various galleons, and because of the unfortunate
temperament of the governor, Diego Fajardo, and his consequent
governing through his favorite.]</p>
<p class="par">That internal war lasted for seven years in the
afflicted community of Manila, and no one dared to undeceive the severe
governor regarding the injuries committed in his name by his favorite,
who made him hated in the community, and guilty of the imprisonment and
exiles that were executed not only on laymen but also on the secular
clergy and religious. For in order to have control of those whom the
Church exempted from his jurisdiction, he succeeded in removing the
dean, Doctor Don Juan V&eacute;lez, from the post of provisor and
vicar-general of the vacant see, and having it given to his intimate
friend and confederate, Doctor Don Francisco Fern&aacute;ndez Ledo.
With that same diligence he contrived and obtained the exile of Doctor
Don Diego de Cartagena y Pantoja<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1799src"
href="#xd21e1799" name="xd21e1799src">23</a> and other secular clergy
to Macasar.</p>
<p class="par">Those who suffered most from his harsh and violent acts
were the [fathers of the] order of our <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb182" href="#pb182" name="pb182">182</a>]</span>father, St.
Augustine, the cause of his wrath being that they had refused to elect
as provincial one of their members who was acceptable and dear to him.
Although the abilities of that father made him merit the office, yet it
was not allowable that it be conferred by that method, so strictly
forbidden by the sacred counsels and canons. Consequently, his wrath
was aroused against the order of our father St. Augustine, and he sent
malicious reports against it to his Majesty in the royal and supreme
Council of the Indias, in letters apparently signed by Governor Don
Diego Fajardo&mdash;who, when he waked from that lethargy, declared
under oath that they were not his. At our petition, the following
governor, Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lara, made a full investigation
before Auditor Don &Aacute;lvaro Garc&iacute;a de Ocampo, the
commissioned judge, in January, 1654&mdash;which proved that all that
was charged by the said favorite against the order was false. He sent
that report to the said royal and supreme Council, and a copy of it is
kept in our archives.</p>
<p class="par">The divine clemency did not choose that the troubles of
afflicted Manila should go further. Therefore He encouraged and
strengthened our father Fray Jer&oacute;nimo de Medrano&mdash;who had
been provincial of this province of ours for three terms, and was its
true father&mdash;to penetrate the deep retirement of the deluded
governor (in whom the father&rsquo;s virtue and age had inspired some
affection and considerable veneration). He informed the governor of the
truth with efficacious arguments, showing him the deceit in which the
cunning of the favorite had kept him buried, while he yielded to the
violent operations of the ambition and cruelty of that man, injuring
his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>own reputation. Divine Providence permitted him
to open the eyes of the deceived governor, because of the favorable
idea that the latter had formed of the accuser; and, seeing that his
honor and his conscience were being endangered, he made the
investigations on his part that were necessary, in order not to
discredit his determination as being precipitate. He found all that
father Fray Jer&oacute;nimo de Medrano had said, and much more, to be
true. Thereupon, he resolved to come to himself, for the sake of the
community of Manila, and had his favorite arrested, September 16, 1651.
Formulating legal proceedings against him for the crimes that he had
committed, he questioned him under torture, in which the prisoner
answered nothing&mdash;either because of his great courage, or because
he had taken some confection of opium, which they purposely gave him to
drink, and which has so narcotic a virtue that it renders those who
drink it insensible to pain.</p>
<p class="par">Among many other injuries that the said favorite had
done to the citizens of Manila was this, that he caused the governor to
hold back the reward that his Majesty granted to General Don Pedro de
Almonte, [in appointing him] master-of-camp, with the bestowal of the
habit of Santiago, for his great services in Ternate, Mindanao, and
Jol&oacute; (some of which we have mentioned before in this history).
[Don Diego did so] because that favorite had risen to the said post
(the second after the governor of Filipinas), as the
regularly-appointed master-of-camp, Don Fernando de Ayala&mdash;a brave
soldier of Flandes in the time of the count of Fuentes, who added so
great luster to the Spanish arms&mdash;had died in the beginning [of
his term]. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">The governor surrendered the appointment to Don Pedro de
Almonte, and put him in possession of the government of the army as its
master-of-camp. Also, as a professed knight of the Order of Santiago,
he gave him his habit in the convent of Santa Clara for the consolation
of a daughter who was a nun there. The prior of our convent of Manila,
Fray Dionisio Su&aacute;rez, was present at the ceremonies that were
celebrated at the said function.</p>
<p class="par">Afflicted Manila began to take breath and that so long
storm died down. For although the governor was by nature so retiring,
he was very upright, and in the highest degree disinterested&mdash;a
quality that rendered his harsh rectitude tolerable. Many who had been
exiled to the presidios of Ternate, Zamboanga, and other forts in these
islands, began to come back to their homes. Many citizens were released
from the prison where they were confined, and returned to attend to the
common welfare, the governor substituting methods of more peaceful
operation, which tempered the austerity of his integrity. The favorite
remained in prison until the new governor, Don Sabiniano Manrique de
Lara, gave sentence in his cause.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1820src"

Andr&eacute;s Verdugo as provincial; and the arrival of Governor Don
Sabiniano Manrique de Lara and Archbishop Don Miguel de
Poblete.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">... The time for holding the chapter-session of
this province arrived. The voting fathers assembled in the convent of
San Pablo in Manila, on May three, 1653. The senior definitor, father
Fray Lucas de Aguilar, presided; and they unanimously elected as
provincial the father lecturer, Fray Andr&eacute;s de Verdugo, a
minister of the province of Tagalos, a prominent religious, and one who
was very learned, prudent, and affable. He bore the name
Verdugo<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1836src" href="#xd21e1836" name=
"xd21e1836src">25</a> by antiphrasis, according to his characteristics,
which were suitable for the office of father and superior. The
definitors elected were the fathers Master Fray Alonso de Carvajal,
Fray Francisco de Madrid,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1839src" href=
"#xd21e1839" name="xd21e1839src">26</a> the lecturer Fray Francisco de
Villal&oacute;n, and Fray Jos&eacute; de la Cuesta,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1845src" href="#xd21e1845" name="xd21e1845src">27</a> who was
very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name=

were present were fathers Fray Lorenzo de Figueroa and Fray Jos&eacute;
de Beto&ntilde;o<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1853src" href="#xd21e1853"
name="xd21e1853src">28</a> (substitute for father Fray Tom&aacute;s de
Velasco,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1863src" href="#xd21e1863" name=
"xd21e1863src">29</a> who had returned to Espa&ntilde;a).</p>
<p class="par">In a private meeting of the definitors which was held in
the convent of Tondo, December 22, father Fray Francisco de
Victoria,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1871src" href="#xd21e1871" name=
"xd21e1871src">30</a> prior of that convent, was appointed procurator
to Espa&ntilde;a with the same commissions and authority which had been
borne by father Fray Juan Lozano, who died the preceding year on the
voyage to Acapulco. But father Fray Francisco de Victoria had the same
fortune, for he embarked the next year and died on the high sea, en
route to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. That voyage is very dangerous to those
who are accustomed to the climate of the Philippines, because of the
great change which is experienced as the galleon ascends to a high
northern latitude (sometimes as high as forty degrees), <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name="pb187">187</a>]</span>and
then again descends to sixteen, in which lies the port of Acapulco.
Therefore, that so sudden change is the cause of many dying on that
voyage, which is the longest, most tedious, and most dangerous in all
the seas. It is undertaken in the most stormy season, when navigation
is denied to the rest of the world; and, in that time, the months of
October and November are the season when our galleons are battling with
the greatest tempests. If it were not for the great strength of the
galleons and the quality of their timbers, that so dangerous navigation
could not be performed; and above all is their safety due to divine
Providence, in whose charge is the conservation of these islands, where
there is so numerous and excellent a Christian people. They apparently
serve as a counterpoise to the ingratitude of the European nations of
the north, who, at the same time when these islands were discovered,
had been seduced by various heresies, and denied obedience to the Roman
Catholic Church and their legitimate kings.</p>
<p class="par">The ship &ldquo;San Francisco Javier&rdquo;&mdash;which
had wintered at Acapulco, as it had arrived late and very hardly
used&mdash;left that port March three; and, having had a very fortunate
voyage by the help of divine clemency, and having profited by the
entire monsoon of the brisas, arrived at so good a season that it
entered the Embocadero of San Bernardino June 26. The mail was sent on
from the island of Ticao, in order to rejoice Manila with the glad news
of the treasure which was coming in that galleon, to wit, the following
persons.</p>
<p class="par">As governor and captain-general of these islands was
coming Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lara, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb188" href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>knight of the Order
of Calatrava, a native of Malaga, late castellan of Acapulco. He was a
brother of the count of Prigiliana, and uncle of his Excellency Don
Rodrigo Manuel Manrique de Lara, count of Aguilar and
Prigiliana&mdash;who was a member of the Council of State and governor
of that of Arag&oacute;n, viceroy of Valencia, of Andaluc&iacute;a, the
coasts of the Ocean Sea, and the royal fleet. He is a gentleman worthy
of eternal renown in these islands, since, if he was not the best, he
is not left behind by any of those who are most remembered for piety,
devotion, and zeal for the service of God and their king. In all things
he had a clear understanding and an admirable eloquence; he was very
jovial by nature, and easily pleased all men. Accordingly, he left
behind not only a lasting memory of his eloquence and
disinterestedness, but also of his discretion. [On his return to Malaga
he becomes a priest.]</p>
<p class="par">Doctor Don Miguel Mill&aacute;n de Poblete, the
consecrated archbishop of Manila, also came. He was a native of the
imperial city of M&eacute;jico, and was an excellent theologian and
canonist, doctoral canon of La Puebla, magistral prebend in the
cathedral of M&eacute;jico, and rector of its university. He had
refused to accept the bishopric of Nicaragua. He was highly esteemed by
Don Juan de Palafox, who consecrated him and gave him the pallium....
With him he brought his nephew, Master Don Jos&eacute; de Poblete, who,
after having been dean of Manila, died bishop-elect of Nueva
Segovia.</p>
<p class="par">There came also the most illustrious master, Don Fray
Rodrigo de C&aacute;rdenas of the Order of Preachers, a native of Lima,
preacher to his Majesty, and consecrated bishop of Nueva Segovia. As it
has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>been his lot to be celebrated by the most
skilful pen of the reverend father master Fray Baltasar de Santa Cruz
in the second part of the History of the province of Santo Rosario, he
does not need the rude tracings of my pen. There came, elected and
appointed as bishop of Ceb&uacute;, the dean of Manila, Doctor Don Juan
de Velas; and as bishop of Nueva C&aacute;ceres or Camarines, the very
reverend father Fray Antonio de San Gregorio,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1891src" href="#xd21e1891" name="xd21e1891src">31</a> lecturer
and calificador and commissary of the Holy Office. He was also
provincial of that province of San Gregorio of the Order of St.
Francis, because of the death of Don Fray Antonio de Zaldivar, a
religious of our father St. Augustine, of the province of
M&eacute;jico&mdash;who died without having been consecrated, in the
year 1649, after he had governed that church for little more than one
year, his death causing great sorrow in all quarters because of his
great virtues and learning.</p>
<p class="par">As auditor came Licentiate Don Salvador Gomez de
Espinosa, an eminent jurisconsult; and, to act as his Majesty&rsquo;s
fiscal, Don Juan de Bolivar y Cruz, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>father of Doctor Don
Pedro de Bolivar y Mena who was auditor and came to an unfortunate end
in our time; for his associates made him an accomplice in the exile of
the archbishop Don Fray Felipe Pardo of the Order of St. Dominic. Two
missions came in that galleon, one of our Recollect religious, and the
other of the Society of Jesus. Some very notable people came, so many
that those who came in that galleon amounted to six hundred persons.
Their journey was so propitious that only three persons died on the
voyage.</p>
<p class="par">The devil was very angry at the great war that he would
have to wage because of the holy prelates and religious who came on
that galleon &ldquo;San Francisco Javier.&rdquo; Accordingly, what he
could not do on the high sea he managed to do from the Embocadero to
Manila. For the winds rebelled against the ship at the island of
Mindoro, and so frightful a tempest arose that the galleon was all but
lost, and in danger of going to pieces on some high reefs about that
island. They cast anchor, and the archbishop conjured the storm, which
immediately calmed itself. That galleon suffered three similar storms
among the islands before they reached the bay of Manila and cast anchor
at Cavite, July 23&mdash;although the governor and archbishop landed
the day before that in a fal&uacute;a which was sent to the middle of
the bay by the castellan of Cavite, the commander Lorenzo Orella y
Ugalde, so often mentioned in this history.</p>
<p class="par">[The governor causes the archbishop to disembark first,
in order that he might bless the land; as if in return for this, the
sardines, which had deserted the bay of Manila at the exile of
Archbishop Guerrero, again entered that bay. The governor, disembarking
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name=
"pb191">191</a>]</span>on the twenty-second, pays homage to the
archbishop. The latter makes his public entry into Manila on the
twenty-fourth and the governor the next day. The Recollects bring a
holy picture (an Ecce Homo) which becomes an object of veneration in
their convent of San Nicol&aacute;s at Manila, where the new governor
attends. The first work of the latter is to take the residencia of his
predecessor, which is entrusted to the direction of Auditor
Sebasti&aacute;n Caballero de Medina. The charges preferred are those
of harsh conduct, but he is so free from covetousness that &ldquo;it is
recounted of him that he only drew for his expenses five hundred pesos
monthly out of the pay of thirteen thousand pesos granted to the
governors of these islands; and accordingly, the balance, a
considerable amount, was afterward paid to his heirs.&rdquo; He appeals
from all the charges to the Council of the Indias, and is sent to
Spain, but dies during the voyage, over seventy years of age.
Fajardo&rsquo;s favorite is condemned to be beheaded, to vast fines,
and to the confiscation of his property. He appeals to Spain, but the
sentence is there confirmed. Before the execution of the sentence,
however, he dies in prison, in poverty. His money and movable property
are confiscated by the treasury and his houses on the square opposite
the cathedral are used later as the governor&rsquo;s palace. The
prelate and the governor work hand in hand in the regeneration of
Manila.]</p>
<p class="par">The first employment of Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lara
in the beginning of his government, was to appoint the brave Francisco
de Esteybar governor of the forts of Ternate,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1910src" href="#xd21e1910" name="xd21e1910src">32</a> and the
commander Don Francisco <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href=
"#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>de Atienza of those of Zamboanga,
for the credit of the arms of Espa&ntilde;a against the Dutch and
against the king of Mindanao, Cachil Corralat. He sent Father Magino
Sola, of the Society of Jesus, to the city of Macan as his ambassador,
to make a treaty of commerce and trade.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1920src" href="#xd21e1920" name="xd21e1920src">33</a> He set a
galleon upon the stocks, but he was unable to do as his great zeal
wished because the royal treasury was exhausted by the lack of supplies
from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and because the trading galleons, which
communicate vital strength to all these islands, had put back so many
times.</p>
<p class="par">[The people of Manila recognize that the evils that have
been visited upon them are due to their sins, and accordingly an appeal
is made to the pope, Innocent X. The latter absolves them from all the
censures and interdicts they may have incurred, and concedes them

the land, and ordered the archbishop to perform in public the ceremony
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=

who has brought that despatch with him, sets the twenty-second of March
for those ceremonies; and before that date a great religious fervor
sweeps through the city and its suburbs. &ldquo;On the Sunday assigned,
the mass was chanted in the cathedral before the holy sacrament, and
the archbishop preached a learned and fervent sermon, such as the
season demanded&mdash;which was afterward printed, as it was worth
being published to all the world.&rdquo; In the afternoon, the blessing
of the land and the benediction in the name of the pope follow. At the
governor&rsquo;s request, the archbishop also blesses the &ldquo;fatal
gate called Puerta de los Almacenes (&lsquo;the gate of the
magazines&rsquo;), through which Don Fray Hernando Guerrero had gone
into exile.&rdquo; The governor lives in great harmony for the ten
years of his service in the Philippines.]</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The archbishop, Don Miguel Mill&aacute;n y
Poblete, came here with the firm determination to pursue the plans of
Don Juan de Palafox y Mendoza, bishop of La Puebla de los
&Aacute;ngeles, who had consecrated him. Those plans had caused great
disturbances in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a because of their novelty, and had
divided that country into the two divisions of Palafoxistas and
Palancas,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1940src" href="#xd21e1940" name=

"#pb194" name="pb194">194</a>]</span>Federico Barbarroja [<i>i.e.</i>,
Frederick Barbarossa] when determinations issued forth to combat with
understandings. Don Juan de Palafox tried to reduce the ministries of
the missions (which the orders had possessed in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a
since the conquest) to regularly-appointed curacies with canonical
institution and collation, so that they could be administered by
ordinary jurisdiction, to the suppression of the delegated
jurisdiction. This was done in order that the ecclesiastical hierarchy
might be one whole in its proportionate parts; and that the episcopal
dignity might possess entire dominion over the shepherds of its sheep,
by visiting them and sitting in judgment on their excesses in the
office of parish priests, which they exercised by virtue of the
concession of St. Pius V and other worthy pontiffs. His great
perseverance obtained that in the form established at present among the
orders, who desired to retain some ministries of the
missions&mdash;leaving others, because that subjection to the bishops
did not seem to them to be in harmony with the institutes of the
orders. I shall not mention the disturbances and scandals that the
common enemy of souls compassed during that time for the ruin of
many&mdash;which filled the world with gloom, and gave perfidious
heretics the opportunity to blaspheme against the Catholic
priests&mdash;for they are very well known.</p>
<p class="par">The archbishops of Manila tried to establish that kind
of ecclesiastical hierarchy in Filipinas, but as he was so holy, and
only desired to promote the greater honor and glory of God (<i lang=
"la">Qui cogitationem <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href=
"#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>pacis et non aflictionis
habet</i>)<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1966src" href="#xd21e1966" name=
"xd21e1966src">35</a> he found considerable inconveniences and even
impossibilities in effecting what he was attempting. For Don Juan de
Palafox had a great plenty of secular priests who were very suitable in
learning and virtue for choosing and presenting for the missions, which
the orders were abandoning, because they refused to submit to the rigor
of the canonical collation in the appointments to the missions. But the
archbishop found a great lack of secular priests in these islands, for
scarcely are there enough in this country to fill the choir of the
cathedral of Manila, with prebendaries and chaplains for the royal
chapel, and some few curacies which the clergy hold in this
archbishopric. For the Spaniards in this country multiply but slowly,
and very few of their sons apply themselves to following the
ecclesiastical life, either secular or regular. That is so true that
the orders could not maintain themselves if it were not for the
continual missions that are brought from the kingdoms of Espa&ntilde;a.
Thus, the clergy is composed of the sons of the Spaniards of this
country, and with these is maintained a cabildo in this cathedral of
Manila, so distinguished that it might belong to one of the first
churches of Espa&ntilde;a; for most of them are doctors in sacred
theology, after having graduated first as masters of arts. He who has
the least degree is a master. All of them are very learned and of known
virtue, which is a cause for admiration, as they live so far from
reward that one rarely passes from the sphere of the dignities of the
said cabildo. For although some have attained the episcopal dignity,
these are very few&mdash;as, for instance, this year their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>dean, Doctor Don Domingo de Valencia, was
promoted to the bishopric of Camarines,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1971src" href="#xd21e1971" name="xd21e1971src">36</a> but at such
an age that he cannot obtain the dignity for a long time. However, in
order to comply with his obligation, and to give the orders an
incentive to represent in judicial form what they had to allege, the
archbishop resolved to place the visitation in execution. He began with
the mission at Binondoc, outside the walls of the city of Manila,
belonging to the religious of St. Dominic, who immediately abandoned
that mission; and the same was done by the other orders, who left the
missions in their control in the hands of the governor as vice-patron.
The latter referred the consultative vote on a so great and weighty
matter to the Audiencia in the royal assembly. It was thoroughly
discussed by the auditors of the Audiencia, who were all very eminent
jurisconsults; and they, recognizing the impossibility of placing in
execution in these islands what Don Juan de Palafox had established in
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, as the system in vogue in these regions is very
different, despatched a royal prohibition to the archbishop, ordering
him to hold his right in reserve, and to suspend what he had begun
until the royal and supreme Council of the Indias should be informed,
and should take suitable measures. The archbishop was notified by the
first and the second royal prohibition; and he obeyed it, and suspended
the visitation, after making his protests. From that time the orders
found him a most loving father and protector. He referred the case to
the royal Council; the orders also [did the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span>same], by the authority which they gave to the
most reverend father master Fray Juan Polanco of the Order of
Preachers, the procurator of the province of Santo Rosario at court.
All the orders renounced the missions in their charge. The president
[of the Council] was the count of Pe&ntilde;aranda, Don Gaspar de
Bracamonte y Guzm&aacute;n, a minister of great talent and experience
in very difficult negotiations, as he showed in the peace of
Nimega,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1977src" href="#xd21e1977" name=
"xd21e1977src">37</a> where he was the plenipotentiary of Don Felipe
IV. That most erudite senate having examined the matter, and having
penetrated like lynxes the most hidden difficulties, imposed silence
for the time being on that innovation.</p>
<p class="par">The perverse spirit of discord which had in charge the
incitement of that litigation in which the prince of darkness profited
by a great number of scandals, discords, and tumults, was suspended and
remained as if asleep for forty-four years&mdash;until it awakened, in
the year 1697, because of our sins. Archbishop Doctor Don Diego Camacho
y Avila,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1982src" href="#xd21e1982" name=
"xd21e1982src">38</a> a native of Badajoz and former magistral canon of
that holy church, and fellow of the chief college at Cuenca in
Salamanca, came to these islands [in that year]. He was a great
prelate, and very vigilant in his pastoral office. He died later (the
year of 1712) as bishop of Guadalajara and was well remembered for his
zeal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>and integrity. [Here follows an account of the
attempt of Archbishop Camacho to enforce the visitation of the
regulars, which we omit in this place, as it will be sufficiently
noticed later.]</p>
<p class="par">In the beginning, the provinces of Am&eacute;rica were
founded entirely in accordance with the regular institutes of communal
houses and convents, with a great number of conventuals; they did not
need to take these from the provinces of Espa&ntilde;a, as they could
choose plenty from the country. On the contrary in Filipinas we have no
more than the convents of Manila, Ceb&uacute;, and Guadalupe as
communal convents&mdash;although only the convent of Manila preserves
that character; while the others, more than seventy-four in number, are
only missions where one single religious lives, and, in a very few, two
ministers, according to the size of the village and the ability of the
province. The latter is wont often to consist of as many priests as
missions, until re&euml;nforcements of religious come from
Espa&ntilde;a; and if that re&euml;nforcement is very slow, then there
are generally more missions than religious as priests. What I say here
of our order is the same of all the others. It is not so in
Am&eacute;rica, Per&uacute;, and Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, where the
convents are established totally independent of the missions. They have
plenty of religious, and those who belong to the land itself, so that
they do not have to send to Espa&ntilde;a for them. Those convents have
their incomes by which they are sustained, so that they do not need any
of the fees of the missions; and consequently, the orders who wished to
retain some missions subject to the ordinary could do so very easily,
by assigning some religious to that mission who knew the language of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href="#pb199" name=
"pb199">199</a>]</span>those villages. Such religious are presented to
the vice-patron, who presents them to the bishop. The latter examines
them, and gives them the collation of the curacy in regular
appointment. They administer that office in subjection to the priors of
the convents, and to their visitation and correction in matters
concerning the order; and in subjection to the bishops, who hold
jurisdiction and visitation over them in regard to any transgressions
in their office as curas. Those religious are maintained perpetually in
their offices, and the chapters cannot change them to other convents;
for they cannot leave their curacies without the intervention of the
vice-patron and bishop, who are very loth to change them because of the
investigations demanded by the presentation, examination, and
collation. Those religious (who are very few) having been dedicated to
that office of curas, the others, who consist of almost all the
religious of the province who are exempt from that occupation, hold
their chapters and change their priors according to the constitutions
of the order.</p>
<p class="par">It is not so in these Filipinas, where, as I have said,
there are so few religious. Supposing that the plan of Don Juan de
Palafox were to be inaugurated, and that all the religious submitted to
receive the canonical collation of the curacies in proprietary
appointment, the conservation and continued supply of religious would
cease. The chapters would cease, for they could not remove the
religious from the villages where they were acting as proprietary
curas; and it would be necessary to keep them where they had their
parishes. Very great difficulties would ensue from that. The province
would cease to send <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200"
name="pb200">200</a>]</span>procurators to Espa&ntilde;a to bring back
religious; and if the generous motive of coming as apostolic
missionaries ceased, they would leave their provinces and
fatherland&mdash;all the more because of being subject to the bishops,
a burden so far from the exemption of the regulars that we watch so
carefully. That subjection would have to be not only to the bishop but
also to the ecclesiastical governors of a vacant see. There have been
so many of the latter in these islands, that in Manila they had them
for fourteen years; and in Ceb&uacute;, Cagay&aacute;n, and Camarines,
for twenty years. The provincials would have nothing left but that
name, and would not have entire control over their subordinates. The
above and many other representations were made to Archbishop Don
Mill&aacute;n de Poblete, and they availed so well with him that he
suspended his resolve. The same things were represented to Don Diego
Camacho, and these same reasons moved the gentlemen of the royal
Council of the Indias to moderate that subjection&mdash;leaving it only
in the visitation, with the limitations already mentioned, thus
enjoining perpetual silence, in regard to erecting the missions into
curacies, and to allowing the orders to abandon the ministries of those
missions.</p>

<p class="par">The archbishop having put aside his doubt in regard to
undertaking the visitation of the regulars, dedicated himself, as a
true prelate, to his other obligations. The first one was the building
of the cathedral, because of the ruin that occurred in it on the fatal
night of St. Andrew in the year 1645; the church of the girls&rsquo;
school of Santa Isabel was being used as a cathedral. He placed his
shoulders very earnestly to that so chief obligation, although the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>poverty of the times made it difficult for him.
He set about collecting materials, and the order of our father St.
Augustine lent him the lime-kilns of Birabira, where the best and
strongest lime of all the islands is made. The pious and Catholic
governor, Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lara, was the one who conquered the
greatest difficulties by collecting a generous alms from the citizens
of Manila, and by giving his aid to the archbishop. The building was
commenced, and, after the trenches for the foundations had been made,
the archbishop clad himself in his pontifical garments and on the
twentieth of April, 1654, blessed the first stone, which was carried by
General Don Pedro de Mendiola. The master-of-camp, Don Pedro de
Almonte, carried on a rich tray a bronze plate with the inscription of
the erection of the church. Captain Don Nicol&aacute;s Sarmiento
carried on another tray five silver coins, and Captain Diego
Castellanos a box of lead. All went in procession to the place where
the stone was to be placed, and the governor and archbishop set it in
position, while the litanies were being chanted. In a hollow already
made in the stone were placed the plate and coins. The inscription on
the plate is as follows:</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;While Innocent X was governing the Church, King
Felipe IV the Espa&ntilde;as, and Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lara,
knight of the Order of Calatrava, the Filipinas Islands, this stone for
the building of this holy cathedral&mdash;its titular being the
Conception, and its patron St. Andrew the apostle&mdash;was placed in
position by Don Miguel de Poblete, metropolitan archbishop, April 20,
1654.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The building of that cathedral proceeded, as the time,
which was very full of troubles, allowed; accordingly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span>it
lasted for many years, two or three years having passed without any
work; and its dedication services were held on September 8, 1671. It is
of Doric architecture and has three naves, and is very strong, as it is
built of heavy stone. It has a reredos of the finest sculpture in these
islands. It was completed by Archbishop Don Diego Camacho y
&Aacute;vila, who built a very beautiful high tower that contains some
very fine bells.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2015src" href="#xd21e2015"
name="xd21e2015src">39</a> He also built the sacristy and other parts
which were wanting for the completion of the cathedral, and adorned it
with a quantity of wrought silver and very rich ornaments and lamps,
which he sent from Guadalajara, for he was not forgetful of his first
spouse.</p>

<p class="par first"><i>Wreck of the galleon &ldquo;San Diego;&rdquo;
the mission that arrived from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a; and the feast of the
Conception of our Lady.</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">This province of ours was very deficient in
religious to fulfil its charge of the instruction and teaching of so
many villages, which were commended to our care as the first spiritual
conquistadors of these remote islands. Nine years had already passed
since the last mission had reached this province (in the year 1645),
during which sixty religious had died; and, besides, the procurators
who had been sent to Espa&ntilde;a to get new missions had suffered the
same fate. Father Fray Cristobal Enriquez, although he reached Madrid,
and presented himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href=
"#pb207" name="pb207">207</a>]</span>before the royal and supreme
Council of the Indias for that purpose, did not obtain a favorable
despatch. For, permission having been given him to conduct thirty
religious to these islands, and trusting to that and having assembled
and conducted many from the provinces of Espa&ntilde;a to Sevilla (in
which he had spent the little that he had for that purpose), a new
decree was issued in which he was ordered to suspend the transportation
of the thirty religious who had been allowed to him, under pretext of
inability to equip them because of the many war expenses of that time.
The religious who were assembled in Andaluc&iacute;a returned to their
provinces; and father Fray Cristobal Enriquez, having spent all his
supply money, died in the city of C&aacute;ceres, which was his
birthplace.</p>
<p class="par">With these losses the province found itself in the
greatest need because of the lack of workmen for the missions in its
charge, until the arrival in 1654 of the galleon &ldquo;San
Diego&rdquo; in charge of the commander Pedro Villarroel de la
Cuesta&mdash;which was wrecked in the beginning of June near the harbor
and bay of Manila, as it went aground on an unknown shoal. However,
only the hull of the ship was lost and all the men and the cargo were
saved. That galleon brought fifteen religious, who had been sent by the
provincial of the province of M&eacute;jico, by virtue of the
authorization given him by the last procurator of this province, Fray
Francisco de Victoria, who died in M&eacute;jico. The said religious
were admitted into this province at a private meeting of the definitors
held on June 13 of the said year 1654. They are as follows:</p>
<p class="par">Father Fray Ger&oacute;nimo de la Serna, who was in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>charge of that mission, forty years old, and
twenty-five in the habit. He had been a prior with vote three times in
his province, and died in the year 1668.</p>
<p class="par">Father Fray Jos&eacute; Polanco, a theologue. He was an
excellent minister to the Tag&aacute;logs and Ilocans, and served in
this province for many years with great credit, for he was an able
minister and skilled in both languages. He died in the year 1681, in a
grievous manner; for, when coming in a champan from the province of
Ilocos, where he was prior of the convent of Bauang, the vessel went to
pieces and he was drowned together with sixteen persons in the same
boat.</p>
<p class="par">Father Fray Jos&eacute; de la Cruz, minister of the
province of Pampanga, where he rendered much service to the order, and
left a lively remembrance of his zeal in the churches of Candaba,
Betis, and M&eacute;xico, which he built from the foundations with
great beauty and strength. He died in the year 1695.</p>
<p class="par">Father Fray Francisco Jord&aacute;n, an excellent
theologue, who was afterward given the title of lecturer. He was a
successful minister to the Ilocans, and a good preacher. He died in the
year 1666.</p>
<p class="par">The father lecturer Fray Lorenzo de Cisneros, who had
taken the habit after he had been a secular priest for many years. He
was an able theologue, and had been one of the household of Don Juan de
Palafox, whom he had served considerably in his litigations with the
regulars of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. That religious was minister to a
Christian village some time in Ilocos; but afterward his mind failed
him, and he lived so for many years, suffering the troubles and
hardships that so troublesome an infirmity <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>causes. I knew him for many years, and he was
never furious, but very mild and gentle. Consequently, he was always
left unshackled, and gave no other sign of the infirmity from which he
was suffering than his outbursts of greatest nonsense. He was ever very
affable and courteous. A few days before his death, he recovered his
mental faculties; and, after having received all the holy sacraments,
he died in great calm in 1662, at an age of more than seventy.</p>
<p class="par">Father Fray Pedro de la Plaza, fifty-three years old, an
excellent theologue, who had also been a secular priest for many years,
and only had three years of profession. He died in 1665 in the convent
of Manila.</p>
<p class="par">The brother chorister, Fray Antonio de Quesada,
twenty-two years old, a student in the arts. He seems to have been a
minister in the province of Pampanga, and very skilful in that
language. He died in 1661.</p>
<p class="par">Brother Fray Jos&eacute; de Sotomayor, who was a
minister in the province of Ilocos, and died in the year 1665.</p>
<p class="par">Brother Fray Bartolom&eacute; de la Torre, twenty-two
years old, who had completed his studies. Afterward he became lecturer
in arts in the convent of Manila, and was sent to the province of
Bisayas, where he was an able minister, definitor, and
vicar-provincial. He died in 1684.</p>
<p class="par">Brother Fray Marcos Zapata, a theological student,
twenty-two years old and five in the habit; he was a minister in the
province of Ilocos, where he died in 1673.</p>
<p class="par">Brother Fray Francisco Flores, of the same age
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>and [length of time in the] habit, was minister
in the province of Tagalos, and died in 1675.</p>
<p class="par">Brother Fray Jos&eacute; de Mendoza, twenty years of
age, was minister in the province of Ilocos, and a fine preacher in
that language. He died in the convent of Manila in 1678.</p>
<p class="par">Brother Fray Luis de Montujar [or Montufar:
P&eacute;rez] twenty years old, was an excellent minister in the
province of Tagalos, definitor, president of the chapter, and my
predecessor in the office of commissary of the Holy Office of the
Inquisition. He was a very observant religious, and died in 1690.</p>
<p class="par">Brother Fray Domingo de San Miguel, twenty-four years
old, a student in the arts. He was a fine religious, of much modesty
and great virtue. He served much and well in the province of Ilocos. He
became visitor, and died in the Manila convent in 1677.</p>
<p class="par">Brother Fray Miguel de Quesada, nineteen years old. I
can find no notice of the province in which he was minister, or of his
death.</p>
<p class="par">Fray Antonio de Salcedo (or San Nicol&aacute;s), a
lay-brother, of great virtue and simple humility. He served the Manila
convent well, and died in 1690.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2084src"

<p class="par">All those religious were natives of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a,
and sons of the province of Sant&iacute;simo Nombre de Jes&uacute;s of
M&eacute;jico. Before admitting them as sons of this province, many and
great difficulties were experienced.</p>
<p class="par">[Continuing, the author discusses these difficulties,
with citation of various authorities. The religious of Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a and Peru administer the sacraments <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>by
authority of the ordinary; while in the Philippines it has been
delegated by the popes to the definitors, who sub-delegate it to the
various religious. In order to go to the Indias, the consent of the
general and of the king is necessary, and is obtained through the royal
Council of the Indias. The difficulty arises, then, because these
religious have not been previously presented in the above Council.
Necessity, however, rules the day, and they are admitted&mdash;although
the precaution is taken by the heads of the order in the islands to
state their intention of obtaining, within six years, the consent and
approbation of the royal Council of the Indias to that admission.]</p>
<p class="par">The loss of the galleon &ldquo;San Diego&rdquo; was felt
keenly, as there was a great lack of ships in these islands because of
the repeated shipwrecks of preceding years. But all knew that it was
apparently permitted by divine Providence so that they might not have a
ship which was built by so many extortions on the natives. That is an
irremediable difficulty in the shipyards and in the cutting of timber
in these islands, as was seen in the building of that galleon
&ldquo;San Diego,&rdquo; which was built in the time of the most
disinterested governor, and one who had the cleanest hands that can be
imagined; such was Don Diego Fajardo, who was a wonder in that way.
Also as superintendent of its building was appointed the commander Don
Pedro de Mendiola, a man as creditable in this particular as the
governor. Yet with all that vigilance, great vexations, wrongs, and
expenses were heaped on the natives. The chief cause was the foreman
and master of the building, who was a Moro named Nadir, who assuredly
was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>the very opposite<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2101src" href="#xd21e2101" name="xd21e2101src">41</a> from the
disinterestedness of Don Pedro Mendiola. This man, from one thousand
two hundred Indians who were drafted monthly from the provinces of
Tondo, Bulac&aacute;n, Balay&aacute;n,and Tayabas, occupied scarcely
four hundred in the work, and sometimes five hundred. The [service of
the] remainder he reduced to money, in which they redeemed their
oppression. A curious person, having reckoned the cost of that galleon,
found that it had cost the king sixty thousand pesos, and the natives
more than one hundred and fifty thousand. This is an evil that has been
seen to be irremediable; for it is impossible to build galleons in any
other way, because the cutting of the timber must be managed by
sailors&mdash;a class of men who lack pity, and have too much
greed&mdash;and because the Indian natives are so weak and so hostile
to work that they prefer their ease to all advantage to themselves.
This has been the cause of the tumults and insurrections, such as that
of Palapag in 1649, and that of the province of Pampanga in 1660; and,
in the time of Governor Don Juan de Silva, that of 1614, because of the
considerable felling of timber which was occasioned by so much
shipbuilding as was caused by the undertaking against the Dutch. Then,
most of the provinces of these islands mutinied and almost rose in
insurrection; and there was danger of a general outbreak, had not the
religious who were ministers in the provinces reduced the minds of the
natives to quiet; for they, overburdened by so heavy a load, were at
the point of desperation.</p>
<p class="par">[In December of 1654 is celebrated the feast of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name=

Virgin&mdash;which was formally proclaimed as a dogma of the Roman
Catholic Church, December 8, 1854. The celebrations in Manila extend
over a number of days, and all take part in them. The papal permission
for the feast has been obtained from Innocent X by the entreaty of
Felipe IV.]</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">[The loss of the galleon &ldquo;San Francisco
Javier&rdquo; in the port of Boronga, in the island of Leyte&mdash;one
of the best harbors in the Philippines&mdash;is keenly felt in the
islands; and, together with the putting back in 1655 of the two ships
&ldquo;Victoria&rdquo; and &ldquo;Santiago,&rdquo; which had sailed for
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, is provocative of much misery. The people of the
first-named vessel are all saved, but all the cargo and money are lost.
The Filipinos along that coast are the only gainers of the wreck, for
they recover much of the money. The loss is investigated by the
auditor, Francisco Samaniego Cuesta, who shows himself unnecessarily
severe in his investigations. The wreck is looked upon by people
generally as a punishment from Heaven for the cruelties practiced on
the natives in the building of the &ldquo;San Francisco Javier.&rdquo;
The islands are reduced to a wretched condition &ldquo;both for the
lack of money (although some was recovered from the &lsquo;San
Francisco Javier&rsquo;), and because the re&euml;nforcements of
infantry were delayed which the governor had requested from the duke of

Espa&ntilde;a; as well as through the fact that trade with China had
greatly fallen off, because of the lack of the food which preserves it,
namely, Mexican pesos.&rdquo;]</p>
<p class="par">Our father provincial, the lecturer Fray Andres Verdugo,
finished the term of his governorship to the universal satisfaction of
all because of his great prudence; and all were desirous to
re&euml;lect him after the six years had passed, which is the length of
time assigned by our rules before the provincial as well as the
definitors and visitors can be re&euml;lected. The time for the chapter
meeting having arrived, the fathers assembled May 6, 1650, in the
convent of Manila. Father Fray Jos&eacute; de la Cuesta, the only
definitor (as the other three first ones had died) presided over the
chapter. As provincial they elected our father Fray Alonso Quijano, a
native of Corral de Almaguer in La Mancha, a minister of very long
standing in the provinces of Visayas; he was a man of great prudence
and wisdom, and great knowledge, and very skilled in the difficult
science of commanding. As definitors were elected Fray Dionisio
Su&aacute;rez, the lecturer Fray Baltasar de Herrera<a class="noteref"

excellent administration of the missions in our charge, and for the
better observance of our rules.</p>
<p class="par">After that chapter had been concluded, not only our
order but also the fathers of St. Dominic and our discalced Recollects
(who had celebrated their chapters on the same day) were confronted by
a great exigency. [This is an order by the governor and royal Audiencia
requiring the presentation of the lists of the chapters, as is done in
the other parts of the Indias. The Audiencia being petitioned allows
the orders to continue their former practice in this regard, after
sending an account of the matter to the Council of the Indias. After a
digression called forth by this exigency, the author proceeds:]</p>
<p class="par">As soon as the new governor, Don Sabiniano Manrique de
Lara assumed his office, and had performed his first duties, and had
taken the residencia of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href=

the cause of the latter&rsquo;s favorite, he devoted himself with great
activity to carrying out such measures as were possible for
establishing the prosperity of his government. He found the community
of Manila greatly afflicted and weakened by its past troubles and wars,
and its wealth exhausted by the lack of commerce with Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, because of the so repeated return of the ships in
distress and the wrecking of the galleons. In that year of 1654 was
lost a large galleon which was being built in the kingdom of Camboja at
great expense to the royal treasury; it was dashed to pieces near
Luban, fourteen leguas from Manila, when it was coming here after
having been completely finished.</p>

<p class="par first">During all his three years in the government of
this province, our father Fray Alonso de Quijano proved himself a
prudent and devout superior&mdash;and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb217" href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>such were needed in
times so calamitous as were those of which we are writing; for a great
deal of misfortune fell to the lot of our province, as we were very
short of religious to serve in the hard work of the missions. For as an
offset to the small re&euml;nforcement that had come in the year 1654
from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, twenty had died&mdash;among whom were the
former provincial fathers, Fray Jer&oacute;nimo Medrano and Fray
Andr&eacute;s Verdugo, who were equivalent to the loss of many, as they
were two firm columns of this province. The procurator who was sent
during the past years, Fray Cristobal Enriquez, had died in
C&aacute;ceres, his birthplace, before obtaining a mission, because of
the many difficulties that he had to encounter, and that is the main
cause of his early death. Father Fray Juan de Torres, who had been
despatched after him, died in this Southern Sea while sailing toward
Acapulco. Thus did this afflicted province find itself reduced to so
short a number of religious that they were unable to sustain so great a
weight. That lack of religious was suffered not alone by our province
but by all the other orders, who complained of the same affliction; for
the loss of so many galleons, and the difficulty in securing despatches
in Espa&ntilde;a because of the many war expenses, delayed the
re&euml;nforcements necessary for the aid of the missions. The worst
was, that as they were so few and carried the work of many, more of
them died; for they were worn out by the too heavy load which necessity
laid upon them. All those adversities were tempered by the wisdom and
great prudence of our father Fray Alonso Quijano during his afflicted
triennium; for his peaceful countenance quieted the most severe storms,
and gave proofs of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218"
name="pb218">218</a>]</span>the great wealth of prudence and sagacity
which reposed in his breast, so that he left all the province desirous
of again placing him in the foremost place of the command whenever they
had an opportunity of making so wise a choice&mdash;as happened in the
year 1665, which will be related in its proper place.</p>
<p class="par">When the term of the three years of his government had
expired, the day assigned by our rules for the celebration of the new
provincial chapter in the Manila convent of San Pablo arrived, namely,
May three, 1659. Father Fray Dionisio Su&aacute;rez, senior definitor
of the former chapter, presided. Our father Fray Diego de Ord&aacute;s
was elected for the second time as provincial, by universal accord; but
with many objections on his side, for he made as many efforts as
possible to escape the election. But the urging of all the
capitulars&mdash;or, to speak more truly, the great prudence and
religious zeal with which he had governed the first time when he was
elected, in the year 1647&mdash;was opposed to his resistance. This
province has always been very cautious in not handing over the helm of
its government to new pilots, even when it has possessed such, skilled
and experienced; for more often the election results with but little
satisfaction if one trusts to appearances, which are wont to be costly
to good government.... The system and composition of this province is
very different from those of the others in Europa, and needs another
kind of competency than what they demand; and so one learns by the road
of experience, in which there is usually less error. There is no
greater assurance for victory than having already conquered. [Some
further reflections similar to the above follow.] As definitors were
elected fathers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219"

of the prudent and magnanimous governor, Don Sabiniano Manrique de

islands had never suffered, so great and continued were they.&rdquo; A
eulogy and partial sketch of the governor follows. Losses of ships,
men, and money, and the scanty re&euml;nforcements sent from Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a&mdash;only a hundred soldiers having arrived, while as
many have died on the way&mdash;are dwelt on. &ldquo;In addition to
that, four <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=

than five hundred men in these seas&mdash;a loss which was the final
blow to the prosperity of these islands.... One million pesos was all
the aid that Don Sabiniano received in ten years, although in years
when there were fewer demands on the treasury five hundred thousand
were sent from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a annually. And the least cost of the
construction of a galleon is sixty thousand, and they are very
frequently wrecked because of the turbulence of the seas.&rdquo; The
author mentions a number of disastrous shipwrecks occurring at various
times in the islands, describing especially that of the
&ldquo;Victoria&rdquo; in 1660, which had been sent to Zamboanga and
Ternate with re&euml;nforcements of men. That wreck occurs while
sailing from Iloilo to Zamboanga, and all hands are lost&mdash;among

<p class="par">Under the mild and pacific government of our father
provincial Fray Diego de Ord&aacute;s, this afflicted province was able
to lift the burden of so many troubles as the adversity of the times
and the great lack of religious occasioned. That lack increased to the
pass that many were giving out under the heavy burden that necessity
forced them to assume; for those most privileged by their age and by
sickness carried burdens that were enough for two, and most of them the
burden of three, so that many succumbed and made the lack greater. With
these disasters came the time for the celebration of a new chapter, to
the great sorrow of all the province at taking farewell of the mild and
prudent government of our father <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222"

They also grieved because there were few experienced persons to
substitute in his place; for a time so full of dangers needed a pilot
experienced in the government of a province so assailed by its
adversaries.</p>
<p class="par">The capitular members assembled in the Manila convent,
and all were unanimous in [their purpose to] elect as provincial father
Fray Jos&eacute; de la Cuesta, prior of Bulac&aacute;n, an able
religious. He was very learned and experienced in the Greek language,
which chair he had filled by substitution in the university of
Salamanca, because of the death of his father, Master Andr&eacute;s de
la Cuesta Olmedo, the regularly-appointed professor of that subject.
But that hope was frustrated, for God had taken him to himself two days
before the chapter, to the general sorrow of all the
province&mdash;especially of our father Fray Diego de Ord&aacute;s, who
had brought him from his province of Castilla in the fine mission that
entered this province in the year 1635. Accordingly, the chapter was
convened under the presidency of father Fray Juan de Borja, the third
definitor, because of the deaths of the [two] others, Fray Pedro
Mej&iacute;a and Fray Pablo Maldonado. Our father, Fray Alonso

<p class="par">It was the will of divine Providence that, after so many
and continual returns of the galleons to port, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name="pb225">225</a>]</span>as
aforesaid, the ship &ldquo;San Jos&eacute;&rdquo; which had left the
port of Cavite in the past year of 1662 under charge of Commander
Francisco Garcia del Fresno&mdash;a native of Cadiz, and very skilful
on the sea; and afterward artillery general for his
Majesty&mdash;should reach Nueva Espa&ntilde;a in safety. The viceroy
of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a was the conde de Ba&ntilde;os, Marqu&eacute;s de
Labrada,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2311src" href="#xd21e2311" name=
"xd21e2311src">59</a> who, after he became a widower, left the vanities
of the world, took the discalced Carmelite habit, was ordained a
priest, and died, bequeathing fine examples of virtue and admonition.
His example was later followed by his son, Don Juan de Leiva, who
received the habit of a lay religious of our father St. Augustine in
the convent of San Felipe in Madrid. The successor of Don Sabiniano
Manrique de Lara, namely, the master-of-camp Don Diego Salcedo, a
native of Bruselas&mdash;a son of a Spanish gentleman (a native of
Cuenca) and a Flemish lady&mdash;was then in the city of M&eacute;jico.
He had been a very brave soldier in the Low Countries for many years,
and for his services had been made master-of-camp of an army of
Walloons.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2317src" href="#xd21e2317" name=
"xd21e2317src">60</a> For that reason, and because he was a favorite of
Don Juan de Austria, whose captain of the guard he is said to have
been, he was granted the government of these islands. On account of the
fact that so many galleons <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href=
"#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>had put back [to these islands] he
had been detained in M&eacute;jico for several years.</p>
<p class="par">In the same city was also found father Fray Jos&eacute;
de Paternina,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2324src" href="#xd21e2324"
name="xd21e2324src">61</a> a son of the convent of Badaya, who had been
detained for three years with a mission of ten religious who had been
sent from the province of Castilla by the procurators of this province
of Filipinas, the father masters Fray Gaspar de Lorenzana and Fray
Francisco de Aguilera. That mission was conducted with the money which
was left owing to this province by its procurator and definitor, Fray
Crist&oacute;bal Enr&iacute;quez, who had died in the city of
C&aacute;ceres, his native place.</p>
<p class="par">At that time our most reverend father-general of all the
Order of St. Augustine, the master Fray Pablo Luquino, was at the court
of Madrid. He had gone to visit the provinces of Espa&ntilde;a and
Portugal. Moved by his great zeal, he aided greatly with his authority
in the collection of that mission, which was small because of the
scarcity of means for its transportation, but large because of the
great lack of religious in this province. As his vicar and prelate of
that mission, he appointed father Fray Diego de Jes&uacute;s, a son of
the convent of Salamanca and a native of B&eacute;jar, and then master
of novices in the convent of San Felipe in Madrid. But the latter
having petitioned our most reverend father-general to be excused
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>from it, because of legitimate reasons that he
had, father Fray Jos&eacute; de Paternina, a native of the town of
&Aacute;lava, and son of the convent of Santa Catalina in Badaya, was
assigned for that duty in his place. He conducted eleven religious of
the province of Castilla and of this province, as they were given the
habit in order to pass thither.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2340src"
href="#xd21e2340" name="xd21e2340src">62</a> They reached
M&eacute;jico, where they were detained three years because of the lack
of the galleons from these islands, as we have related.</p>
<p class="par">At the same time Don Andr&eacute;s de Medina, with a
Peruvian gentleman, a man most skilful in astrology, mathematics, and
cosmography, had arrived at M&eacute;jico from Madrid. He had offered
to his Majesty to discover the islands called Salom&oacute;n because of
their great wealth.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2347src" href=
"#xd21e2347" name="xd21e2347src">63</a> These are the islands which
Adelantado Alvaro de Menda&ntilde;a y Neira went to discover in the
year 1595, with four vessels which he took from Callao in April of the
said year. His chief pilot was Pedro Fern&aacute;ndez de Quir&oacute;s,
who is mentioned in the first part, book 3, chapter 16, page
476.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2353src" href="#xd21e2353" name=
"xd21e2353src">64</a> After having endured many hardships, and after
the adelantado had died, his men reached the port of Cavite under
command of the adelantado&rsquo;s wife, Do&ntilde;a Isabel Barreto, in
February of 1596, and later returned to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a in the
galleon &ldquo;San Ger&oacute;nimo.&rdquo; Mention of that discovery
will be found <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>in the relations of Doctor Don Antonio de Morga,
which I omit here, as it is foreign to our subject. Don Andr&eacute;s
de Medina brought royal decrees ordering the viceroy of Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a to give him vessels in the South Sea, and men, for that
discovery and conquest; but it was impossible to do so at that time,
because of the lack of ships, which is constant on the said sea.
However, in order to content him, because of the letters and decrees
that he bore, the viceroy, Conde de Ba&ntilde;os, appointed him
commander of the galleon &ldquo;San Jos&eacute;,&rdquo; after removing
its commander, Francisco Garcia del Fresno, who had brought the galleon
from Filipinas. That was contrary to the royal ordinance, which
prohibits the viceroys to change the commanders (unless the commander
has died), and those who have the future succession to the governorship
of the Filipinas.</p>
<p class="par">When the time arrived, Governor Don Diego de Salcedo
embarked, taking with him the most distinguished train of people that
has been seen on any occasion. For of captains alone there were
twenty-six, and I think it advisable to inscribe their names here,
because of the great honor and prestige that they brought to the
community of Manila. They were as follows: Don Antonio Sanchez de
Quir&oacute;s, ex-captain of cuirassiers in Flandes; Juan Martinez
Corrionero, alf&eacute;rez and adjutant in Flandes; Don Francisco de
Moya, Don Juan de Briones, and Don Tom&aacute;s de Castro

Gim&eacute;nez; Don Pedro de la Mancha, Don Diego Casta&ntilde;eda, and
Don Miguel de Alegr&iacute;a; the chief pilot, Leandro Cuello; and
others. Two auditors embarked, namely, Licentiate Don Francisco de
Coloma Maceda, and Licentiate Don Francisco de Mansilla Montemayor; and
many other persons of account.</p>
<p class="par">Father Fray Jos&eacute; de Paternina, whom the
Inquisitors of M&eacute;jico had appointed commissary of the Holy
Office for the city of Manila, embarked with eleven of our religious;
and father Fray Cristobal de Santa M&oacute;nica, of the discalced
religious of our father St. Augustine, with another fine and more
numerous mission&mdash;among whom was that virtuous and erudite
preacher, Fray Isidoro de Jes&uacute;s Mar&iacute;a, one of the best
preachers of that century, whose sermons might arouse admiration in
Europa. Where he surpassed, moreover, was in those that he preached,
for twenty consecutive years, on the sorrows of most holy Mary. But his
sermons did not have the good fortune to be printed, except the first
on that subject, and a few others on other festal occasions.</p>
<p class="par">Governor Don Diego was very angry at the affront that
the viceroy had put upon the commander, Francisco Garc&iacute;a del
Fresno, without any authority <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230"
href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>for it beyond the mere
authority of viceroy. Therefore, as soon as the galleon left the port
of Acapulco and had lost sight of land, he ordered the drums to be
beaten, and deprived the commander Don Andr&eacute;s de Medina of his
office, which he restored to Francisco Garc&iacute;a. When that was
learned in the royal and supreme Council of the Indias, his Majesty
approved of it, and issued a new decree ordering the viceroys of Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a not to change the commanders or those who were to succeed
in the second place [as governor]. Don Andr&eacute;s de Medina, being a
wise and prudent man, made no resistance, except that he retired to the
quarters of the boatswain, from which he did not emerge until the
galleon after many months cast anchor at Cavite.</p>
<p class="par">The galleon &ldquo;San Jos&eacute;&rdquo; sighted these
islands late, and, as the vendavals had set in, could not make port in
either Palapag or Lamp&oacute;n. After having suffered many storms they
were obliged to make port in the most remote and unsuitable
harbor&mdash;namely, that of Pasipit, in the province of
Cagay&aacute;n, which lies in 19 degrees north latitude. The governor,
the auditors, and the two missions disembarked, and after many
hardships traversed five provinces by land, three of which (Ilocos,
Pampanga, and Bulac&aacute;n) were in our charge, and two
(Cagay&aacute;n and Pangasin&aacute;n) in charge of the religious of
St. Dominic. Our small mission was so unfortunate that three of them
died in the province of Ilocos: namely, father Fray Tom&aacute;s de
Villanueva, a religious already aged, of the province of Castilla;
brother Fray Bartolom&eacute; de Grecia, a native of La Mancha; and
father Fray Juan de Ezquerra. The other eight reached Manila after so
long a journey; and these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href=
"#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>were received there [with the
demonstrations] that the great lack of religious in the province
demanded. They were as follows:</p>
<p class="par">The father-commissary of the Holy Office, Fray
Jos&eacute; de Paternina, son of the convent of Badaya, forty years
old. He became prior of Manila and Guadalupe, and died at sea in the

Burgos, and a native of &Aacute;lava. He was an excellent and efficient
minister in the province of Ilocos. He went to Espa&ntilde;a and Roma
as procurator for this province, whence he returned with a plentiful
mission of religious in the year 1679. He returned to the province of
Ilocos, where he died in the year 1699 with the reputation of great
virtue.</p>

<p class="par">Father Fray Juan de Guedeja, native of Salamanca, son of
that convent, and thirty years old. He was a minister in Pampanga, and
very skilful in that language. He was a religious of various

<p class="par">Brother Fray Diego de la Puente, native of Madrid, son
of this province, twenty-one years old. He was a minister in the
province of Pampanga, and very fluent in that language. He was a
religious in whom were reposed great hopes, which were disappointed by
his early death in 1677.</p>
<p class="par">Brother Fray Juan de Ibarra, native of Durango, son of
this province. He was a minister in Ilocos for a short time; most of
his life (which was very long), he passed in the convent of Manila,

<p class="par">Of the two auditors the senior in rank, by concession of
his Majesty, was Don Francisco Coloma. But Don Francisco Mansilla, as
he was stronger and younger went on ahead in forced journeys, and took
possession of his seat in the royal Audiencia. After a considerable
time, Don Francisco de Coloma arrived, and demanded the seniority that
belonged to him by precedence in their appointments as auditor.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=

severity, or from envy. He is, however, cleared of all charges in
Spain; and 60,000 pesos that he has been compelled to deposit are
returned to him from the treasury of Mexico.]</p>
<p class="par">Don Diego Salcedo commenced his government with the
disaster of the return in distress of the ship &ldquo;San

great affliction, since no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href=

its voyage to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a in safety. But divine clemency willed
that better success should be experienced by the first galleon that he
despatched during his government, namely, the &ldquo;San
Jos&eacute;&rdquo;&mdash;the vessel in which he had come, and in which
Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lara returned to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. That
galleon was the most fortunate of all that have been built in these
islands, for it never had to put back in distress, and lasted for many
years. It brought two governors to Filipinas, Don Diego de Salcedo and
Don Manuel de Le&oacute;n; besides taking back in safety the other, Don

"pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>great intelligence and wisdom, and commenced to
govern to the satisfaction of all. His first measure was to place on
the stocks the galleon &ldquo;Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la
Concepci&oacute;n&rdquo; a work of the great master, Juan Bautista
Nicol&aacute;s. He sent ambassadors to the surrounding kingdoms to
build up the commerce which is the mainspring of the community of
Manila and all these islands. He sent the commander Don Juan de Vergara
to the kingdom of Camboja, accompanied by Captain Fernando Quintela, to
discuss the building of galleons in that kingdom. That mission had no
effect, however. He sent Don Jos&eacute; de la Vega, a native of
Manila, treasurer of the royal exchequer, a man of great intelligence
and capacity, to the kingdom of Banta; and Don Francisco
Enr&iacute;quez de Losada to the kingdom of Siam. All complied with the
obligation of their duty, which was directed to the establishment of
commerce and friendly relations. He also sent Don Juan de Zalaeta to
Batavia to buy anchors for his galleons, as there were no smithies in
Filipinas where they could be made of the size demanded by those
galleons. That commerce was very good in his time, and Captains Juan de
Ergueza, Diego de Palencia, and others made repeated voyages, and
brought back quantities of cinnamon and spices which are very
profitable to the commerce of Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. In these and other
arrangements and provisions the whole year 1664 passed during which
time no event of consideration, or any worth writing, occurred.

<p class="par">Our father Fray Alonso Coronel having completed the term
of three years of his government&mdash;which was filled with fears and
hardships, because of the unfortunate events that we have just related
in the threats of the pirate Kuesing Pompo&aacute;n&mdash;the time
assigned for the celebration of the chapter in the convent of Manila
arrived, namely, April 25, 1665. The senior father definitor, Fray Luis
de Medina, presided at that chapter, in which our father Fray Alonso
Quijano was elected for the second time, as he was a person of whom
this province had experienced the worthiness of administering the
government of it; for he had ruled so efficiently during the triennium
when he was provincial the first time. As definitors were elected the
following fathers: Fray Tom&aacute;s de Villanueva, Fray Cosme de
Hiz,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2454src" href="#xd21e2454" name=

efficient government of the province, and such that one recognizes the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=
"pb238">238</a>]</span>care and vigilance that were taken in preventing
the slightest neglect in matters pertaining to the regular observance,
and in the care for better administration in the office of parish
priest. In that chapter was renewed once more the urgent request of the
governor for the list of the appointments of prior-ministers. But it
was resolved not to establish such a precedent and they were aided in
that by the fathers of St. Dominic, who also held their chapter on the
same day&mdash;when they elected as their provincial father Fray Juan
de los &Aacute;ngeles, who was worthy of that name because of his many
virtues.</p>
<p class="par">The new provincial, seeing the lack of religious from
which this province was suffering, on account of its failure to receive
large missions, which would furnish abundant workers for the
maintenance of so many and remote convents and missions as were in its
charge&mdash;for, although diligent efforts had been made to remedy
that lack, three procurators who had been sent to Espa&ntilde;a had
died; and the third, father Fray Jos&eacute; Boto&ntilde;o, after
having been forced to put back to port twice, died during the voyage,
the third time when he embarked&mdash;appointed for that duty father
Fray Isidro Rodr&iacute;guez, a native of Madrid and minister of the
province of Pampanga, of whom we have given a memorial in the [relation
of the] insurrection of the said province. That was an excellent
appointment, for he made his voyage successfully, having embarked on
the galleon &ldquo;Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la
Concepci&oacute;n,&rdquo; under command of the commander Jos&eacute; de
Zamora. He brought back the most numerous mission that had thus far
entered these islands.</p>
<p class="par">On June 17, 1665, the fortunate galleon &ldquo;San
Jos&eacute;&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239"
name="pb239">239</a>]</span>arrived at the port of Cavite, with the
most illustrious bishop of Ceb&uacute;, already consecrated, the master
Don Fray Juan L&oacute;pez, of the Order of Preachers, native of
Mart&iacute;n-Mu&ntilde;oz de las Pasadas. He was a prelate who gave
great consolation to the Christian people of these islands&mdash;both
in the bishopric of Ceb&uacute;, where he remained for seven years; and
in Manila, where he died archbishop-elect in the year 1674, after
having suffered many cares. He was a very learned and affable prelate,
and was accordingly greatly beloved by all. In the same galleon came
also the auditor Licentiate Don Juan de Pe&ntilde;a Bonif&aacute;z, a
native of Segovia, of whom there will be much to say in due time,
because of his beginning to govern the military department in the year
1668, which was the origin of great disturbances.</p>
<p class="par">Near the boundaries of the province of Ilocos, in the
mountains of Cape Enga&ntilde;o, near the province of Cagay&aacute;n,
belonging to the mission of the convent of Bacarra, the conversion of
the natives of the villages of Acl&aacute;n and Vera (now Bangbanglo)
was commenced that year by the ardent zeal and diligence of father Fray
Benito de Mena, a native of Manila and son of our Manila convent San
Pablo; he was a religious of great virtue, and one very fluent in the
tongues of Ilocos and Cagay&aacute;n. Those villages are more than
twenty leguas distant from the central town Bacarra; and their people
are a barbarous and spirited nation, and for that reason are feared by
the Indians round about. They are known by the name of Payaos.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2515src" href="#xd21e2515" name=
"xd21e2515src">76</a> That nation had not received the light
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name=
"pb240">240</a>]</span>of the holy gospel, because of the ruggedness of
their mountains. They were living in the darkness of their blind
paganism, protected by the inaccessibility of those lofty mountains,
and exempt from the yoke of subjection&mdash;the only means by which
one is able to introduce the evangelical preaching among barbarous
nations. For since they are the last nations whom the Celestial
Paterfamilias invites to the banquet of glory, which so many noble and
civilized nations have despised, in them is verified the command to
make them enter by means of force: <i lang="la">Compelle intrare, ut
impleatur domus mea</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2531src" href=
"#xd21e2531" name="xd21e2531src">77</a>...</p>
<p class="par">Father Fray Benito, moved to piety by his great zeal at
seeing how difficult it was for those natives to receive the knowledge
of our faith in that way, as they were remote and invincible, having
first consulted with God in prayer, determined to enter those
mountains, accompanied, in order to remove suspicions, by only the few
whom he could take. He went to the village of Ba&ntilde;gui, the last
visita of Bacarra, where he established a military base [<i lang=
"es">plaza de armas</i>] for that spiritual conquest. Ba&ntilde;gui is
distant four long leguas from the first settlement of the Payaos,and
one must ascend a river with a strong current. Wisely repeating his
entrances by means of that river, he introduced himself gradually among
them, and preached the holy gospel to them, which they heard without
any difficulty, as they are a people who have but little tenacity in
holding to their heathen ceremonies. They only practice various
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>superstitions, auguries, and a servile worship
to the souls of their first progenitors&mdash;whom they reverenced not
as gods, but like the Indigetes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2542src"
href="#xd21e2542" name="xd21e2542src">78</a> of the Romans, to whom the
people offered sacrifices to keep them propitious. This method of
worshiping deceased ancestors is very common in these Filipinas, and
very difficult to stamp out, even in those who are to all appearances
faithful Christians. For in this regard fear has a great influence over
them; and most of them believe that it is not opposed to the Christian
faith to place on one and the same altar the ark of the testament and
the idol Dag&oacute;n.... But scarce a trace of this malign belief is
to be found in the villages near Manila.</p>
<p class="par">[Many miracles and prodigies influence those rude people
to receive baptism. Especially efficacious for the faith is the
resurrection of a child who has died, and who after receiving holy
baptism dies again (five hundred and two persons becoming baptized in
consequence). A leper is also healed with the ceremony of baptism. The
chief seeks salvation in the holy waters before his death. The new
converts prove exceptionally clever in learning the prayers and the
Christian doctrine, a night or a day often sufficing.]</p>
<p class="par">Great were the troubles that father Fray Benito de Mena
suffered in that conversion, because of the steepness of the mountains,
and because there was no lack of ministers of Satan among the Payaos
who endeavored to dissuade the people from what that religious was
teaching them. But he, persevering in teaching them the truth until the
year 1668, attained <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242"
name="pb242">242</a>]</span>the fruit of his fatigue; for he converted
so many that he was able to found the three villages of Acl&aacute;n,
Vera, and Bangbanglo, which were administered in the church that he
built in the village of Acl&aacute;n under the advocacy of St.
Catherine, virgin and martyr. Those villages are today a part of the
ministry of Ba&ntilde;gui, the most remote of all this island of
Manila. A settled minister is assigned to it when there are plenty of
religious in this province for such work. When there is the greatest
lack of religious, the administration is under the charge of the prior
and minister of the village of Bacarra.</p>
<p class="par">The villages of Acl&aacute;n and Vera are very useful as
frontiers opposed to the Calanasas, a cruel heathen nation; and for
that reason the governors of Manila have exempted them from paying
tribute. That religious Fray Benito de Mena was an able evangelical
minister, and obtained much fruit in the province of Ilocos. He was
much given to prayer and mortification; and a long chapter could be
written of his life, if the notices of the curious prodigies that
happened to him had not been lost&mdash;events in the conversion of the
Indians of the mountains of Acl&aacute;n and Vera, and in other
villages of that province, where he died holily as prior of the convent
of Bacarra in 1676.</p>
<p class="par">Don Diego de Salcedo, having heard of the remote nations
who were living free from the yoke of political subjection in the
larger and better part of the island of Manila, and who possessed the
best lands of the fertile forests of Ilocos&mdash;the worst thing being
that they were living in the Cimmerian darkness of paganism, and that
so many souls were being lost because of our neglect and carelessness;
and seeing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name=
"pb243">243</a>]</span>that the islands, harassed for so many years by
the insurrections of those natives and the threats of foreigners,
seemed to be quiet (for the gates of the temple of Janus were shut in
his time, which had been open during all the terms of his three
predecessors): planned to undertake some conquest that would result to
the honor of God and extend the Spanish government. He assembled the
most experienced and skilful captains of those islands and the
provincials of the orders, as they were the ones who would have the
greatest part in the preservation and continual increase of what would
be conquered. All thought that the best field of conquest in which to
employ their arms with some profit was the mountains of Ilocos, where
the Igolotes lived in broad and fertile lands, abounding not only in
food but in minerals rich in gold&mdash;which the natives themselves
bring in great plenty to Pangasin&aacute;n and Ilocos to barter for
clothes, salt, and other things which they need.</p>
<p class="par">The Igolotes<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2560src" href=
"#xd21e2560" name="xd21e2560src">79</a> are a barbaric race of scanty
intelligence. They are of lighter complexion than the other natives,
both because they are born in a cooler climate and because they are
descended, according to their own traditions, from Chinese who were
shipwrecked on those coasts long before the Spaniards arrived in those
islands, as say their barbaric and confused accounts. That assertion is
proved by the closeness with which their customs approach those of the
Chinese although they are not provided with a regular government, or
civilized, as are the latter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244"
href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>For they are deceitful,
cunning, and cruel, a sign of their cowardice. Accordingly, they never
undertake any warlike deed unless it promises them perfect security;
and to such an extent is that true that it is sufficient for one to
fall to make them all seek safety in flight. Therefore they do
considerable harm in the villages of Pangasin&aacute;n and Ilocos
alone, by setting fire to them, or by means of very safe ambushes. They
have but little adherence to their false religions, but are very
superstitious and practice divination. In that respect they greatly
resemble the Payaos and Calanasas<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2571src"
href="#xd21e2571" name="xd21e2571src">80</a> above mentioned. They are
opposed in all their customs to the Abacaes<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2574src" href="#xd21e2574" name="xd21e2574src">81</a> and
Italones<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2583src" href="#xd21e2583" name=
"xd21e2583src">82</a> of the mountains of Santor in Pampanga. They
practice bigamy [<i>sic</i>] for they marry many women; and they regard
theft as great cleverness. Their usual weapons are arrows, and some
chiefs carry lances and <i>balaraos</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, daggers] which
they buy in other villages with their gold. Father Fray Esteban
Marin,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2602src" href="#xd21e2602" name=
"xd21e2602src">83</a> a religious of Ours, suffered <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>martyrdom among that race in the year 1601, as
is mentioned in the first part, book 3, chapter 22, folio 502.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2612src" href="#xd21e2612" name=
"xd21e2612src">84</a></p>
<p class="par">Having made the preparations for that conquest, the
governor appointed Admiral Pedro Dur&aacute;n de Monforte, a brave and
experienced soldier (of whom repeated mention has been made in this
history) the chief commander of it. He gave him the title of lieutenant
captain-general, and a sufficient number of soldiers, both Spanish and
Pampango. The sargentos-mayor Blas Rodr&iacute;guez and Don Jos&eacute;
de Robles Cort&eacute;s accompanied him, as did also Captains Gabriel
de la Jara, Francisco de Espinosa, Don Pablo de la Piedra, and Lorenzo
Rubio, and Adjutants Pedro Bravo, Juan de Mercado, and Francisco de la
Jara&mdash;all leaders and veteran soldiers. He asked our father
provincial, Fray Alonso Quijano, to appoint evangelical ministers to go
to the preaching and teaching of the villages which would be conquered.
The provincial appointed father Fray Lorenzo de Herrera<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2620src" href="#xd21e2620" name=
"xd21e2620src">85</a> (former prior of Narbac&aacute;n in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>Ilocos), father Fray Lu&iacute;s de la
Fuente,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2628src" href="#xd21e2628" name=
"xd21e2628src">86</a> and Fray Gabriel Alvarez,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2634src" href="#xd21e2634" name="xd21e2634src">87</a> for that
mission. The governor also appointed the commander Don Felipe de Ugalde
as purveyor and paymaster for those troops, giving him four thousand
pesos for that purpose. Don Felipe, however, did not accompany the
army, but went later; and his self-confidence was the cause of his
death. For at the point of the uninhabited district the Zambals went
out against him; and, although he defended himself with great valor, a
valiant Zambal named Tumalang killed him. That man became a Christian
after the event of Pignau&eacute;n, and was named Don Alonso. He cut
off the purveyor&rsquo;s head, as we have mentioned in another chapter,
[treating] of the year 1656.</p>
<p class="par">Pedro Dur&aacute;n marched with his men by short stages,
because of the inconvenience to the infantry and baggage, and for fear
of the ambushes which could be set against him in the many defiles that
offered along the road. He always had spies who knew the roads, and
Pampanga scouts, and friendly Zambals together with Sargento-mayor Blas
Rodr&iacute;guez and the adjutant Francisco de la Jara, and some
Spaniards. Without the occurrence of anything <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name=
"pb247">247</a>]</span>worthy of consideration, they arrived at the
first two villages of the Igolotes&mdash;called Cayang,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2644src" href="#xd21e2644" name=
"xd21e2644src">88</a> of one hundred and fifty houses; and Lobing, of a
few less. They found these deserted, but they remained there to await
the rest of the convoy. The site of Cayang was very pleasant, and
suitable for a military post, as it was the nearest to the villages
that had been subdued. Consequently, Pedro Dur&aacute;n determined to
build a fort for his defense until, by means of the Zambals and
Ilocans, the Igolotes should become quieted and reduced to their
houses. He treated the natives well, and the soldiers who might
transgress by offering them the least injury he punished. Gradually
many of the chief Igolotes came, and showed themselves to be obedient,
and friends of the Spaniards, and well inclined to profess the
evangelical law and be baptized. A church was built of such materials
as could be found in those mountains, because of the difficulty of
finding bamboo near there. The same and greater difficulty was
experienced in building a fort of palisades and a terreplein; for all
that land was bare, and had no forests of timber. Therefore it cost the
soldiers considerable labor to find timber and bring it from afar, as
they did, without any disaster having happened to them.</p>
<p class="par">That exploration was made near the end of 1668, the time
when the Spaniards were in those parts. Of their doings in detail, only
very short and confused accounts have remained. It is only reported
that they explored one hundred and fifty villages, from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>the
heights of Cayang to the mountains of Cagay&aacute;n. Most or them are
located on the shores of large rivers, all of which flow into the great
river of Cagay&aacute;n, which empties [into the sea] at Lalo. It is
the largest river that is known in all the Filipinas Islands; and is
said to be larger than the Danubio [<i>i.e.</i>, the Danube.]</p>
<p class="par">The Spaniards did not neglect to look for gold-mines,
for the working of which they took along miners and plenty of tools.
But although they found mines in the latitude of 17 degrees, from which
the Igolotes extract very fine gold, our miners could not obtain any in
all the assays that they made; for all went up in smoke. That was one
of the reasons that made that conquest drag on, as it was very costly
and very remote. The names of the villages which rendered obedience
were the following: Cayang, Lobing, Masla, Sumader, Anquiling, Balugan,
Maguimey, Tadi&aacute;n, Balococ, Caagitan, Otocan, Bila, Cagubatan,
Guindajan, Banaao, Pingar, Pandayan, Naligua, Singa, Banao, Payao,
Agava, Lobo, Madaguem, Balicoey, Bilogan, Balicnon, Biacan,
Pangpanavil, Gambang, Mogo, Leodan, Dugungan, Sayot, Calilimban, Sanap,
Sabangan, Alap, and a valley called Loo, with nine villages. But those
which paid something as recognition were Peglisan, Tanon, Maynit,
Guinaan, Amtadao, Malibuen, Bucog, Balignono, Bali&aacute;n, Malibcon,
Dingle, Datalan, Agava, Malibuen, Talabao, and others&mdash;whose names
I omit, as they are of little importance, and which exceed one hundred
in number.</p>
<p class="par">The governor, in order that that conquest might be made
more easily, ordered that the fort of Pignau&eacute;n be established in
Zambales, with a sufficient <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href=
"#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>garrison of soldiers and some
small pieces of artillery. As its commandant he appointed
Sargento-mayor Blas Rodr&iacute;guez. Afterward, in the term of
Governor Don Juan de Bargas jurisdiction was given to the commandant
who then was Captain Alonso Mart&iacute;n Franco; he is still living to
govern the villages of Zambales, Nuevo Toledo, and others, in which he
places justices and governors. That fort is the check that restrains
the raids of the Zambals of Playa Honda, a cruel and barbarous race,
who consider their highest good the cutting off of heads, which is
their great badge of nobility.</p>
<p class="par">The fruit obtained by fathers Fray Lorenzo de Herrera,
Fray Lu&iacute;s de la Fuente, and Fray Gabriel Alvarez in that
conquest was considerable, for they reduced entire villages to the
knowledge of our holy faith; in the beginning, they succeeded in
inducing many children and old people who were about to die to have the
good fortune to die as Christians. But they bore themselves with great
caution and prudence, for they feared that it would be very difficult
to preserve that field of Christendom unless those people were reduced,
and removed to a more suitable site, secure from the continual wars
which some villages waged against others. Thus many were led to settle
in the villages of Ilocos, and others in those of Zambales. But what
most hindered that so important reduction was the frustration of the
hopes for the rich gold mines which so incited greed; for all those who
went on that expedition were boasting that they were already
Cr&oelig;suses and Midases. It is certain that there are very wealthy
mines and placers in the rivers, whence the Igolotes get the great
quantities of gold which they have brought <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>down
to sell to the provinces of Ilocos and Pangasin&aacute;n; but it
appears that divine wisdom does not choose that they shall fall into
our hands, for it was very certain that we would make an ill use of
that benefit....</p>
<p class="par">[Great sorrow is caused to the province by the death of
Fray Diego de Ord&aacute;x, August 12, 1666. He was a native of the
city of Le&oacute;n, and had come to the islands in 1635. He became a
missionary in the Bisayas, and was twice prior of Manila, and twice
provincial. Most of his life in the islands was passed in the convent
at Manila. In 1666 are celebrated the funeral ceremonies for Felipe IV,
who died September 17, 1665.]</p>
<p class="par">Governor Don Diego de Salcedo, considering the many
oppressions that were experienced by the provinces near Manila from the
continual cutting of timber and building of galleons&mdash;a necessary
evil, and one in which the wrongs that are committed in it can be
obviated only with great difficulty&mdash;very prudently determined to
build the galleon &ldquo;Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Buen Socorro&rdquo;
in the province of Albay. He entrusted its execution to the commander
Diego de Ar&eacute;valo who was most experienced in maritime matters.
He appointed him alcalde-mayor of the adjoining province of Camarines,
for the better expedition of the timber-cutting, putting him under
greater obligations [to do well] by the future reward of commander of
the galleon which he was about to build. In order that that galleon
might be built more quickly and finished sooner, he sent as chief
overseer his lieutenant master-of-camp, Don Agust&iacute;n de Cepada
Carnacedo, who was then master-of-camp of the army of these islands for
his Majesty, in order <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href=
"#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>that he might live in the port of
Albay. He did that with so great care that in little more than one year
the largest and best galleon that had yet been seen in the islands was
built&mdash;and very few so large have been seen in European seas, and
extremely few that are larger. For that purpose the woods of Filipinas
are the best that can be found in all the universe; because for the
inside work, the ribs and knees, the keel and rudder molave is
used&mdash;which is the hardest wood known; and at its disintegration
it is converted into stone by being kept in the water. Lavang<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2672src" href="#xd21e2672" name=
"xd21e2672src">89</a> is used for the sheathing outside the ribs; it is
so strong and of such a nature that no artillery ball will pass through
it; and the greatest harm that the ball can do is to stick in the wood
without entering inside the ship. On account of that advantage the
galleons of these islands are so formidable to the Dutch; for each one
is a strong castle in the sea. When the galleon &ldquo;Nuestra
Se&ntilde;ora del Buen Socorro&rdquo; was finished, it sailed from
Albay, August 28, 1667, under command of Diego de Ar&eacute;valo, with
Juan Rodriguez, a Portuguese, as its chief pilot. The patache
&ldquo;San Diego&rdquo; left Cavite to accompany it, under charge of
Admiral Bartolom&eacute; Mu&ntilde;oz. They had a fortunate voyage, and
arrived in due time at the port of Acapulco.</p>
<p class="par">The ship &ldquo;Concepci&oacute;n,&rdquo; which had
sailed from these islands in the previous year of 1666, in charge of
Commander Don Juan de Zalaeta&mdash;who remained in Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, where he took the habit of Santiago, and was
alcalde-mayor of the city of La Puebla de los Angeles, and castellan of
Acapulco<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>&mdash;also arrived in safety at these islands.
(Afterward Don Juan returned to these islands, in the year 1684, as
judge of the residencia of Governor Don Juan de Vargas Hurtado. That
residencia was very tedious and occasioned that judge great troubles.)
On that voyage he had taken with him the famous and valiant commander
Francisco de Est&eacute;ybar who also remained in M&eacute;jico, where
he lived blind for many years.... On its return trip that galleon
carried Doctor Don Diego de Corbeta, his Majesty&rsquo;s fiscal, and
Do&ntilde;a Mar&iacute;a Jim&eacute;nez, his wife. A mission of the
discalced religious of our father St. Augustine also came. The galleon
was in great danger, for some of the criminals who were being sent in
it for the galleys and presidios of these islands tried to mutiny; but
this was checked in time, and the guilty were punished.</p>
<p class="par">Those and other like troubles have occurred in Filipinas
because so many criminals and persons who have committed various crimes
have been sent from M&eacute;jico, and form in these islands the sink
[of the iniquity] that prevails here. For those who sometimes merited
the punishment of the gallows are confined here, under pretext that
they are sent to serve in the galleys, of which we generally have none.
And since the need of men is so great, because of the lack of
Spaniards, the authorities are compelled to enlist them as soldiers;
and from that they continue to advance to the highest military rank,
for they are the ones to whom Fortune is more favorable than to others
who are more worthy of taking precedence of them.... It is true that
there is some relief from that abuse at present. For, on petition of
the governors of these islands, the viceroys <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>of
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a now send those condemned for such crimes to the
conquest of Pansacola [<i>i.e.</i>, Florida], which was discovered in
the time of the Conde de Galber [<i>i.e.</i>, Galves].</p>
<p class="par">That year the galleon &ldquo;Buen Socorro&rdquo; sailed
from Albay after it was completed, under its commander Diego de
Ar&eacute;valo and its chief pilot Juan Rodr&iacute;guez. It sailed
August 28, and was in great danger for it ran aground as it left the
harbor; but it was gotten off easily by the great energy and skill of
the commander. The galleon was the best that was ever built thus far in
these islands; and its size, beauty, and swiftness were amazing. It had
two tanks of water, so large that one of them was more than enough for
the entire voyage to Acapulco, and the other served for the return, and
a quantity of water was left&mdash;a great convenience for the sea,
when one suffers so great lack of water. From this it is inferred that
the water of Filipinas does not become foul, either going or coming, as
the English say of the water of the river T&aacute;mesis of
Londr&eacute;s [<i>i.e.</i>, Thames, of London]. The patache &ldquo;San
Diego&rdquo; left the port of Cavite, under command of Admiral
Bartholom&eacute; Mu&ntilde;oz,to go in its convoy&mdash;the fortunate
Argo that was to conduct those chosen heroes, the apostles for the
Marianas Islands, the associates of the venerable father Diego
Lu&iacute;s de San Vitores.</p>

<p class="par first">(<i>1668&ndash;69</i>)</p>
<p class="par">The time assigned by our sacred rules for the election
of a new provincial came. The fathers who had votes, having assembled
in the Manila convent, held their chapter on April 21, 1668, under the
presidency of father Fray Tom&aacute;s de Villanueva, as he was the
senior definitor of the preceding chapter. He was assisted by the
rector provincial, our father Fray Alonso Coronel. Our father Fray
Dionisio Su&aacute;rez a celebrated minister of the provinces of
Tagalos, son of the convent of Salamanca, who came to these islands in
1627, was elected provincial, to the general satisfaction of all. As
definitors were elected fathers Fray Juan de Vergara, Fray Francisco de
Medina Basco, Fray Andr&eacute;s de Salazar,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2718src" href="#xd21e2718" name="xd21e2718src">90</a> and Fray
Pedro de Mesa.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2724src" href="#xd21e2724"
name="xd21e2724src">91</a> The visitors, Fray Jos&eacute; de Mendoza,
and Fray Jos&eacute; Duque, were present&mdash;in whose <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>place were elected fathers Fray Crist&oacute;bal
Marroqu&iacute; and Fray Carlos Bautista.</p>
<p class="par">They enacted ordinances and statutes of great utility
for the better administration of the missions in our charge, and for
the better government of the province, which, as they were so good and
proved so useful, have been re&euml;nacted in many subsequent chapters.
At that time this province was in great need of religious to serve in
the ministry of the missions. Consequently, it was necessary to pile
work upon them till they were overburdened (that addition being the
most grievous part of the load); and therefore many fathers were
entrusted with two districts, and only one was placed in other large
districts that needed two or three. The other orders were suffering
from the same diminution, and the secular clergy was almost a cipher.
Consequently, there was no recourse but to abandon some missions, so
that those which remained in our charge might be better administered.
But divine Providence hastened to our relief in that great affliction
with an abundant re&euml;nforcement, the greatest that this province
had obtained since its origin.</p>
<p class="par">In the middle of July 1668, the galleon &ldquo;Nuestra
Se&ntilde;ora del Buen Socorro,&rdquo; in charge of the commander Don
Diego de Ar&eacute;valo, sighted the first land of Filipinas, namely,
the cape of Espiritu-Santo. That vessel carried seventeen religious who
were sent from Espa&ntilde;a by the father procurator of this province,
Fray Isidro Rodr&iacute;guez as part of [a band of] fifty priests and
choristers, and in addition three lay-brothers of the mission, whom he
had obtained from the queen-mother, who was acting as ruler. They were
not all able to embark, partly because the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>fleet which was to sail to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a
had been broken up, and partly because the religious could not be
accommodated in two ships of the windward fleet&mdash;which was in
charge of Don Agust&iacute;n de Yustigue, knight of the Habit of
Santiago, its commander&mdash;which were to carry back quicksilver for
the mines. For Don Diego Espejo with his family was crossing [the
ocean], with the appointment of corregidor from M&eacute;jico; and he
presented a royal decree ordering that one-half of the poop, in which
some of the religious had to come, be given to him. For that reason
only twenty-two could embark in the flagship, where they suffered great
discomfort. Two of them died in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a and some remained
there sick, so that only seventeen sailed in that ship &ldquo;Buen
Socorro.&rdquo; In the following year of 1669, father Fray Isidro
sailed with the rest. The patache &ldquo;San Diego&rdquo; took Father
Diego Lu&iacute;s de San Vitores and his associates to the islands of
Marianas to begin that spiritual conquest. He was an apostolic man, and
even to look at and talk to him infused an inner joy and
consolation&mdash;as I confess happened to me in Acapulco, where I had
the good fortune to know and talk to him. Two Dominican religious [also
came], namely, father Fray Antonio Calder&oacute;n, who came as
chaplain, and father Fray Arcadio del Rosario; besides father Fray
Antonio Godinez of St. Francis, who came as his associate and
secretary,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2738src" href="#xd21e2738" name=
"xd21e2738src">92</a> to visit this province of San Gregorio.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">I cannot refrain from mentioning what happened to that
galleon when it was at Capul, an island of the Embocadero of San
Bernardino; namely, that when the nineteenth of July dawned the galleon
was joined by a craft of peculiar shape&mdash;somewhat like those used
by the Indians of the Marianas Islands, painted with the same color of
vermilion earth, but larger than four of their boats. It held six
persons, whose entire bodies were painted<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2747src" href="#xd21e2747" name="xd21e2747src">93</a> black. But
they were so weak that they seemed to be living skeletons, except one
of middle age who was fat and robust, tattooed, and with a long beard.
They ascended into the galleon without showing fear or distrust; but no
one understood their language, although we had a sailor who knew the
language of Marianas well, as he had been shipwrecked in the galleon
&ldquo;Concepci&oacute;n&rdquo; in the year 1636, and had lived for
some time in those islands. It could only be conjectured from the signs
that they made that they had come from the south. They remained in the
galleon, where they were relieved in their necessity, which was lack of
nourishment. They ate nothing that had touched the fire; but rice and
fish, all raw. All of them died except the boys, of whom the commander
and pilot took charge. After some years, when they knew our language,
they said that they came from an island near Nueva Guinea&mdash;without
doubt the Garbanzos, Columnas, Jardines, or others which the maps show;
or the islands of the Palaos, in the discovery of which Father
Andr&eacute;s Serrano of the Society of Jesus toiled so much, until he
lost his life by drowning, with other religious and many Spaniards, in
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>year 1711, after having gone to Roma, Madrid,
and Paris, to negotiate the affairs of that discovery and the
conversion of those souls. But he will have already received the reward
for his holy zeal and great labors.</p>
<p class="par">The religious of the mission disembarked at Capul July
20, and the flagship &ldquo;Buen Socorro,&rdquo; after weathering many
storms, made the harbor of Lamp&oacute;n. The religious reached Manila
in groups all through the month of August, after making their voyage by
land, and receiving the greatest attentions from the religious of the
Order of St. Francis&mdash;in whose vigilant care are the provinces of
Camarines, Tayabas, and Laguna de Bay; and they showed the fervent
charity which was left them as an inheritance by their seraphic
patriarch.</p>
<p class="par">That mission was a great relief, although it was small;
for most of the choristers were very soon ordained, dispensation for
their age being granted through the <i>omnimodo</i> authority conceded
by his Holiness Adrian VI to the prelates of the mendicant orders of
Indias in his famous bull given at Zaragoza in 1522, the first year of
his pontificate. That privilege has been very useful for the conversion
and instruction of the natives of the Indias; and it is still in force,
as it was conceded to the emperor Carlos V, although foreign authors
have tried to destroy it by saying that it was revoked&mdash;authors
such as Angelo Mar&iacute;a Berrecili, Fagnano,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2762src" href="#xd21e2762" name="xd21e2762src">94</a> and
others.</p>
<p class="par">The death of our father Fray Alonso Coronel was
regretted deeply in this province (he died in Manila, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href="#pb259" name=
"pb259">259</a>]</span>August 9 of that year 1668), for he was one of
the prudent superiors that this province has had, and a very learned
and able religious. He was an efficient minister in Tagalos for the
period of thirty-three years that he spent in these islands.</p>
<p class="par">Father Fray Manuel Quintero,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2779src" href="#xd21e2779" name="xd21e2779src">95</a> accompanied
by the father visitor Fray Antonio God&iacute;nez, his two associates,
and father Fray Arcadio, embarked in a caracoa to cross the Embocadero
of San Bernardino, to land in Bulusan. In crossing there one must leave
affairs to the disposition of the Indians of the country, pilots who
know the time when one must cross&mdash;namely, when the tide ceases to
rise, and has stopped&mdash;for then one can pass without the slightest
difficulty. But if one chooses another time, no ship of high freeboard,
[even] with all its sails and with a favorable wind, can resist the
current, which is so strong that it will cause the ship to spin round
and round. Those fathers being newly come, were unwilling to leave
themselves to the management of Indians, or to await the point of the
tide, but obliged the Indians to cross. In the midst of the passage the
boat overturned; and a Spaniard, the nephew of father Fray Manuel,
named Don Gregorio Quintero, and two other Spaniards were drowned.
Father Fray Manuel and the secretary of the father visitor, a Vizcayan,
who were fine swimmers, reached land with great difficulty. The father
visitor, his associate, and father Fray Arcadio did not abandon the
craft, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>accordingly were saved by the Indian rowers; but
they reached land after being sadly buffeted about. The father visitor
lost his letters-patent and papers, and consequently did not make his
visit. He returned to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a after having passed many seas
and suffered many troubles, and after having been obliged to put back
to port in the year 1669. He was later provincial of the province of
San Diego. The currents of that Embocadero are so terrible that the
roar of the tide when it is low can be heard for many leguas.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e2787src" href="#xd21e2787" name=
"xd21e2787src">96</a> The reckoning of its flow and ebb is so variable
that great mathematicians who have given themselves to that speculation
have not been able to understand it....</p>
<p class="par">Shortly after their arrival at the Manila convent, in
the month of October, the Lord was pleased to take to himself His
devoted servant father Fray Jer&oacute;nimo de Ramos, 84 years of age,
a native of Castilla la Vieja, and son of the convent of Burgos, who
came to this province in the year 1627.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2796src" href="#xd21e2796" name="xd21e2796src">97</a> He was a
Tag&aacute;log minister, and was indefatigable in instructing his
parishioners. He was much given to mortification <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>and
prayer, so that most of his time was passed in that holy exercise in
the choir. For many years he had lived retired in the Manila convent,
without leaving the house; and he was the example and wonder of that
community. He suffered very patiently from a very troublesome illness
for the space of twenty years. No word was heard from him except those
of great edification and full of love of God, and hence his death was
like his holy life.</p>
<p class="par">During all of Don Diego Salcedo&rsquo;s term of office,
which lasted for five years, there was little satisfaction for the
community of Manila, for the commerce of China which is the most
necessary thing was very slight, because of the wars which
Sipu&aacute;n, the son of Kuesing, waged with the Tartars; and
consequently the champan that came from China was very rare indeed. The
inhabitants of Manila were very greatly dissatisfied with his
government, for they thought that he was hindering their interests by
preferring his own&mdash;the ordinary complaint against the governors.
Since the merchandise was but little in that time, all could not be
satisfied&mdash;a matter almost impossible for those who govern, and
especially in these islands, where he who has the supreme command is
regarded as guilty of all the disasters. Added to this, he had had
disputes with the municipal corporation of the city; for he tried to
give his captain of the guard, Don Juan de Ezquerra, a public seat with
the cabildo, and he had arrested the alcalde-in-ordinary, General Don
Sebasti&aacute;n Rayo Doria, over that matter. But what the citizens
regretted most keenly was the loss of their wealth&mdash;for the
governor bought at wholesale most of the merchandise, by the hand of
his factor Gaspar <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262"
name="pb262">262</a>]</span>Ruiz de Aguayo&mdash;and the repeated
voyages which Juan de Ezquerra made to Batavia at his account, in which
they had no part or profit. It is certain that a fine intelligence was
wasted in that gentleman; but his mind swelling with pride on account
of his great authority made the citizens despise him, and from that he
finally became hated.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2808src" href=
"#xd21e2808" name="xd21e2808src">98</a> Consequently he had a fatal
end, namely, arrest by the Holy Office of the Inquisition through the
father commissary, Fray Jos&eacute; de Paternina.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2811src" href="#xd21e2811" name="xd21e2811src">99</a> And
inasmuch as I am in duty bound to mention that imprisonment, I shall
only relate what belongs to the matter, as my obligation includes
nothing else.</p>
<p class="par">At eleven o&rsquo;clock at night on October nine, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>father commissary of the Holy Office of the
Inquisition went to the governor&rsquo;s palace, accompanied by brother
Fray Juan de Panos.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2818src" href=
"#xd21e2818" name="xd21e2818src">100</a> In their company they took
Captain Francisco de Vizcarra, alguacil-mayor of the Holy Office; the
commander Sebasti&aacute;n Rayo Doria and Captain Don Nicol&aacute;s
Mu&ntilde;oz de Pamplona, alcaldes-in-ordinary of the city of Manila;
Sargento-mayor Don Juan de Morales, and Captain Juan Tirado; Captain
Don Lu&iacute;s de Morales Camacho, Captain Don Tom&aacute;s de Castro
y Andrade, and Captain Don Gonzalo Samaniego. Besides these, entered
Captain Miguel de C&aacute;rdenas, and Captain Diego de Palencia;
Alf&eacute;rez Antonio de Monroy, familiar of the Holy Office; the
reverend father Fray Francisco Solier, provincial of the Order of St.
Francis; and fathers Fray Mateo Bay&oacute;n<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2824src" href="#xd21e2824" name="xd21e2824src">101</a> and Fray
Francisco de Pamplona of the same order, of the Friars Minor. The
master-of-camp, Don Agust&iacute;n de Cepeda Carnacedo, who had
purposely placed on guard in the palace his nephew, Don Miguel de
Alegr&iacute;a, with his company, was there beforehand waiting for
them. They all went up to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href=
"#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>the sleeping-apartment of the
governor, while the master-of-camp remained in the guardroom and gave
orders to the soldiers not to stir even if they heard some noise
above.</p>
<p class="par">The father commissary, the alcaldes, the religious, and
some of the company went upstairs, while the others remained below with
the master-of-camp; and the former reached the sleeping-apartments of
Don Diego de Salcedo. They summoned a servant maid to open the door,
telling her that the factor Juan de Verastein, who was bringing the
silver from the ship &ldquo;Buen Socorro&rdquo; which was at
Lamp&oacute;n, had arrived; and the maid opened the door without
mistrusting danger.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2831src" href=
"#xd21e2831" name="xd21e2831src">102</a> All of them entered the
apartment and, reaching the governor&rsquo;s bed, awakened him. At the
same time they cut the fastenings of the bed-canopy, which, falling
down upon the governor in his half-awake condition, left him enveloped
in it, and unable to make the slightest movement of defense. They had
planned to do this, in order that the governor might not be able to
make use of a rack well supplied with firearms, which he kept loaded
and ready at his bedside. At that juncture the commissary arrived, and
told the governor that he must surrender to the Holy Office of the
Inquisition, to which the governor in his confusion had no other answer
to make than &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and saying that he yielded himself a
prisoner. A pair of manacles that they had prepared were placed on him.
As they were riveted home Don Diego de Salcedo said &ldquo;Do not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265" name=
"pb265">265</a>]</span>hurt me;&rdquo; to which one of the bystanders
answered &ldquo;Your Lordship has hurt us more.&rdquo; That appeared
very wrong to the others, and they checked the lack of respect which
that person showed. That man, it is said, was the commander and
alcalde-in-ordinary Sebasti&aacute;n Rayo Doria.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2842src" href="#xd21e2842" name="xd21e2842src">103</a></p>
<p class="par">A hammock was brought, and, half dressed as he was, the
governor was placed inside it. Descending by a private stairway, and
taking him through a rear door quite remote from the guardroom, they
took him to the convent of St. Francis,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2850src" href="#xd21e2850" name="xd21e2850src">104</a> where he
stayed one day. Next day he was taken to the house of Captain Diego de
Palencia, where he was kept for some days until he was removed to the
convent of our father St. Augustine. There he was imprisoned in a high,
large, and comfortable room, which was used by the religious for the
view and for recreation. He remained there until he was embarked on the
patache &ldquo;San Diego;&rdquo; and while there his custodian,
steward, and servant was Captain Miguel de C&aacute;rdenas, who looked
after his comfort with great care. That captain embarked with him and
tended him until his death, which occurred in the year 1670, in the
second voyage that he made; for the patache &ldquo;San Diego&rdquo; had
put back to this port, under charge of Admiral Don Francisco de
Vizcarra, alguacil-mayor of the Holy Office. After the eve of the
Nativity, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>father commissary, who was appointed prior of
the convent&mdash;as the father-definitor, Fray Pedro de Mesa, who had
been prior, had resigned&mdash;ordered that Don Diego be fastened to a
chain. The reason for chaining him was, that many signs showed that his
servants and adherents were trying to rescue him on the night of the
Nativity. It was even reported, but not believed, that poison was first
to be given to the prior and the commissary and to the religious of the
convent, by means of a splendid collation which was to be sent
them.</p>
<p class="par">Don Diego de Salcedo sustained that so grievous blow
with so great steadfastness that he caused admiration in all people;
for he was never heard to assign another reason for his imprisonment
than that it was a present which God was sending him for his many sins.
For it is considered certain that if he had cried out, when he was
arrested, to the halberdiers of his guard, and if they had called upon
the soldiers of the guardroom, a great disturbance would have happened,
however much the master-of-camp tried to restrain them. I am witness of
that, for I went often by order of the father commissary and prior to
amuse him when he was sick. I admired his great courage and prudence,
as well as his strong mind; and it seemed as if he had no resentment
that could give him anxiety. One may believe that so great conformity
to His most holy will was gained by the aid of God. That which I always
heard to be a fact must have been true, namely, that that gentleman had
great love and special veneration for the most venerable father Diego
de San V&iacute;ctores,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2857src" href=
"#xd21e2857" name="xd21e2857src">105</a> of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>the
holy Society of Jesus, whom the governor aided considerably by
co&ouml;peration [with him] in his entrance into the Marianas Islands.
It is said that he requested the said venerable father to ask God to
give him in this world his purgatory for his sins. The venerable father
replied that he should think well what he was asking, for the
Lord&rsquo;s aid is necessary when He bears down His hand, in order
that one may not refuse to endure His paternal correction. The father
told him that time after time, but Don Diego de Salcedo always
persevered in asking the same thing. The venerable father must have
obtained that heroic petition from God; for when he bade farewell to
him on going to the mission of the Marianas Islands, it appears that he
gave Don Diego de Salcedo to understand that the Lord had granted his
petition. Therefore, that very submissive spirit and the prayers of the
venerable father Diego Lu&iacute;s de San V&iacute;tores,one can
believe, were the cause of his great patience and resignation.</p>
<p class="par">Such was the imprisonment of Governor Don Diego de
Salcedo, and the evil lot of that gentleman who possessed so great
endowments of valor, discretion, and urbanity, besides his personal
qualities; for he was tall and well-proportioned in all parts of his
body, and his face was handsome, serious, and modest. His flowing hair
was very long and white; and his mustache, a distinction in the men of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>that time, was very black. His complexion was
very light, and his eyes blue, and all gave him a grave and noble
appearance. Nothing could be seen in him that was not very chaste, and
only in his covetousness was any transgression recognized in him. As
covetousness is the root of all evils, his lukewarmness in attending to
many obligations belonging to a Christian governor proceeded from that.
The consequences of his imprisonment lasted for twenty years, counting
imprisonments, embargoes, exiles, and refuge sought in the sanctuary by
those who took part in that imprisonment. The father commissary, Fray
Jos&eacute; de Paternina, was summoned to M&eacute;jico by the
Inquisitors; and the reverend father master Fray Felipe Pardo, of the
Order of Preachers, afterward archbishop of Manila, was appointed in
his place. Father Fray Jos&eacute; de Paternina died on the voyage to
Acapulco, and we only know that the tribunal of the Holy Inquisition of
M&eacute;jico celebrated public and honorary funeral services for him.
The rest of the matter does not concern me; it was my part only to
refer to the fact of this imprisonment, in order to follow the thread
of my history.</p>
<p class="par">The alcaldes-in-ordinary and the municipal corporation
of the cabildo informed the gentlemen of the royal Audiencia [of the
arrest] that same night, in order that they might fulfil their
obligation, which was to appoint the senior auditor to the government.
The auditors&mdash;Licentiates Don Francisco de Coloma y Maceda, Don
Francisco de Monsilla y Montemayor, and Don Juan Manuel de la
Pe&ntilde;a Bonifaz&mdash;and Doctor Don Diego de Corbera, the fiscal,
met in the assembly hall. They discussed the question of who was the
senior auditor; for Don Francisco <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269"
href="#pb269" name="pb269">269</a>]</span>de Coloma had held that
office longer, but had assumed the office later, because Don Francisco
Mansilla (as we have mentioned before) had gone on ahead from
Cagay&aacute;n. The controversy waxed very bitter, for neither would
yield; and the third auditor, Don Juan Manuel, and the fiscal sided
with neither of the contestants. Finally Don Juan Manuel treated the
matter so ably and wisely that he made them agree to give him charge of
the government until the controversy should be decided. The two other
auditors and the fiscal assenting thereto, the charge of military
affairs was given to Don Juan Manuel de la Pe&ntilde;a Bonifaz; and the
master-of-camp took possession of the army, and the city received his
oath.</p>
<p class="par">On the same day, Don Juan Manuel arranged the camp to
suit his own pleasure. He appointed Don Juan de Morales Valenzuela
sargento-mayor, after removing Don Nicol&aacute;s Sarmiento; he made
his own son, Don Juan Manuel, captain of his guard, and changed many of
the infantry captains. It seems that the two auditors Coloma and
Mansilla feared some violence; and for greater harmony retired,
together with the fiscal Don Diego de Corbera and the secretary of the
chamber, Tom&aacute;s de Palenzuela Zurbar&aacute;n to the college of
the Society of Jesus, and convened the Audiencia in the library of the
said college. They despatched a number of royal decrees ordering Don
Juan Manuel to govern and rule as they two determined, since it was
they who owned that right, which was still in litigation. But it
appears that Don Juan Manuel had no such intention, and so much was he
able to do by his sagacity and the interposition of grave persons (in
which intervened <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270"

Olivera, Don Eugenio Guti&eacute;rrez de Mendoza, and Don Juan de
Rosales, that after many controversies, which have no place here, the
two auditors and the fiscal were confined to their homes. When one
would have thought them safest, Don Juan Manuel arrested them all in
their own houses. He sent Don Francisco de Coloma to the village of Bay
with an order to the alcalde-mayor Don Antonio Quijano to watch over
his person; and Doctor Don Diego de Corbera, the fiscal, and his wife
Do&ntilde;a Mar&iacute;a Jim&eacute;nez to the island of Luban,
fourteen leguas from Manila&mdash;where he died in a few months, I know
not whether of sorrow or illness. He ordered Don Francisco
Mansilla<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2894src" href="#xd21e2894" name=
"xd21e2894src">108</a> to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href=
"#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span>embark in a champan for Octong,
delivering the care of his person to a brave mulatto&mdash;a native of
Sevilla, and a soldier of Ternate&mdash;named Sim&oacute;n de Torres,
whom he made captain of the fleet of Iloilo, sending a very stringent
order to the sargento-mayor Francisco Prado de Quir&oacute;s not to
allow Don Francisco to leave that presidio. He did so, and the auditor
remained there until the new governor, Don Manuel de Le&oacute;n,
ordered that he be recalled thence. Don Francisco de Coloma remained
but a short time in Bay, for, like the good Christian that he was, he
submitted himself, yielding to the condition of the times, in order to
avoid scandal. Thus Don Juan Manuel withdrew him, and the two ruled
over political matters, Don Francisco Coloma signing first, and Don
Juan Manuel de la Pe&ntilde;a governed in military affairs.</p>
<p class="par">All that government of the usurper Don Juan Manuel was
very peaceable; for he was a wise and prudent man, and of very
excellent intentions. If the desire to command misled him into pushing
himself into the government, which did not belong to him, the fault
ought not to be attributed to him, but to those who allowed themselves
to be deceived because of their passions.... The first thing that he
did was to bring from Ceb&uacute; that great soldier, so often
appointed in past years, the commander Don Francisco de Atienza y
B&aacute;&ntilde;ez&mdash;who had retired, and was passing his
honorable old age in quiet; and Don Juan availed himself of his
counsels for military <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href=
"#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>arrangements. He treated the
soldiers very well, and increased their pay, and paid them a sum of
money on account of what was due them for their services. In that way
he exhausted the royal treasury; and it was this which created most
hostility against him in the royal Council. He must have thought that
his government would last a longer time, for Don Diego de Salcedo had
served five years in his government, and, according to the length of
time that his three predecessors had governed, a long time was still
left for Don Juan. But this reckoning ended ill; for Governor Don
Manuel de Le&oacute;n was in M&eacute;jico, because authentic
information had reached the royal Council of the Indias of the
irregularities committed by Don Diego de Salcedo.</p>
<p class="par">At that time the bishop of Ceb&uacute;, Don Fray Juan
L&oacute;pez, arrived at Manila on matters pertaining to his church
concerning the result of the visitation which he had made in the
province of Ogtong. But as he found the governor very busy in
strengthening his intrusion, while the royal Audiencia was much in need
of ministers, he could get nothing done except the issue of some
pontifical acts regarding orders and confirmations, and to return to
his church.</p>
<p class="par">However much Don Juan Manuel de la Pe&ntilde;a tried by
diligence to please all, he was not without danger of his life through
the malice of assassins or the neglect of undisciplined soldiers. For
while he was one afternoon watching the marching of the companies which
are changed daily as guards at the gates of the city, it happened that
when an obsequious military officer was ordering that a general salute
to him be fired, a musket ball passed over Don Juan Manuel&rsquo;s
right shoulder, and was embedded in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb273" href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>brick wall of the
window from which he was leaning. Investigations were instituted in
order to get at the cause; but they were all in vain, as those who
fired were so many, and it could not be learned who had loaded with
ball. The governors have many such dangers because of the carelessness
of the undisciplined soldiers. Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lara was in
danger of being killed in another salute like that; and the ball passed
clear through the hand of Licentiate Manuel de Olivera, who was at the
governor&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p class="par">The pens of jurisconsults were not lacking to defend the
government of Don Juan Manuel de la Pe&ntilde;a as legitimate. Among
others, Licentiate Don Juan de Rosales, a lawyer of the royal Audiencia
and alcalde-mayor of Tondo for the new governor, published a printed
manifesto of which many copies may be found in possession of persons
who are curious. But afterward, at a safe time, he published another
manuscript against his antagonist Licentiate Manuel Su&aacute;rez de
Olivera, in which he not only accuses Don Juan Manuel of being a
usurper, but also as guilty of lese-majesty. <i lang="la">Tot capita,

<p class="par">The government of Don Juan Manuel de la Pe&ntilde;a
lasted for eleven months, amid great quiet for the community of Manila,
as he was very prudent and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href=
"#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>peaceable, and, above all,
disinterested&mdash;which appears to have been lacking in his
predecessor, on which account there was so great discontent with the
latter&rsquo;s government.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e2937src" href=
"#xd21e2937" name="xd21e2937src">110</a> He despatched two galleons
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name=
"pb275">275</a>]</span>to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a&mdash;&ldquo;Nuestra
Se&ntilde;ora del Buen Socorro,&rdquo; in charge of the same commander,
Diego de Ar&eacute;valo; and the flagship &ldquo;San Diego,&rdquo; in
charge of Don Francisco Vizcarra, alguacil-mayor of the Holy Office,
who had arrested Don Diego de Salcedo. The latter was served by Captain
Miguel C&aacute;rdenas, Juan de Alquiza, and others. But neither of the
two ships made the voyage; for the flagship, which sailed from
Lamp&oacute;n, put back at Cavite, and the almiranta, which sailed from
Cavite, put back at Lamp&oacute;n. They placed Don Diego in the convent
of Guadalupe, whence, as he was sick, they took him to Los Ba&ntilde;os
on Laguna de Bay. He left there the following year, in order to
prosecute his voyage to Acapulco; and he died in the northern latitude,
very well prepared, and as a good Christian&mdash;leaving behind great
hopes for his salvation, as one whom our Lord had brought back to
obedience by the road of tribulation, through so grievous a stroke.</p>
<p class="par">The galleon &ldquo;San Jos&eacute;,&rdquo; which had
left Cavite the year before, returned from Acapulco in the month of
July; and as the vendavals had prevented its making that port by way of
the Embocadero, it was obliged to anchor, and to seek safety in the
port of Palapag in the province of Leyte. That galleon brought the new
governor, Master-of-camp Don Manuel de Le&oacute;n y Saravia, a native
of Paredes de Nava, a valiant soldier from his youth in the countries
of Flandes, Galicia, and other parts. He had begun the rudiments of the
military art in the celebrated battle of Lutzen, in which died that
thunderbolt of the north, Gustavo Adolfo, king of Suecia, in the year
1632&mdash;who caused so great destruction in Alemania [<i>i.e.</i>,
Germany] by his captains Gustavo <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276"
href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>Hom, Bernardo de Veymar,
Bautis Gratz, and other heretics until the battle of Norlinguen, fought
by the cardinal infante in the year 1634,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2977src" href="#xd21e2977" name="xd21e2977src">111</a> which
battle also Don Manuel de Le&oacute;n participated; and the latter had
been in other famous battles of those times. He had been an infantry
captain for fifteen years in Flandes, and was afterward sargento-mayor
and master-of-camp. He was moved from Flandes with his army to the
frontiers of Galicia to fight against Portugal in the year 1660. There
he gave so good an account of himself that he was called &ldquo;the
iron leader&rdquo; because of his valor and daring. He was governor of
Munz&oacute;n and Valencia in Galicia. While he was soliciting an
office in Madrid, the queen-mother and her associate governors tried to
send him to be governor of C&aacute;diz; but he elected to come to
Filipinas, retaining the office of master-of-camp and the reward of the
habit of Santiago. We can believe that divine Providence made him
desire that charge so that he might be the consolation and remedy of
these islands; for in his time the islands enjoyed the greatest quiet,
happiness, and plenty that they had enjoyed for many years. For the
voyages from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a were more secure and not a single
galleon was lost; and commerce with China and Mac&aacute;n was very
flourishing, as it was likewise with the coast of Coromandel, this
latter being established <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href=
"#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>in his term. There were no wars
with the Dutch, nor with any other foreign nation; nor did any province
revolt. The Mindanaos did not make their usual raids, and there was
perpetual peace because of the quiet behavior and the death of Cachil
Corralat. There were only some incursions by the Camucones, who are
thieving pirates subject to Borney. The fruits of the earth were very
plentiful, and no earthquakes or other disasters occurred. The
community of Manila, which had been living for so many years in
continual fear, thought now of nothing else than of their trade and
merchandise, and of feasting and rejoicing. To that happiness was added
the fact that Don Manuel de Le&oacute;n was by nature very benevolent,
pious, simple, and very even in disposition; and, above all, far
removed from cupidity and self-interest, and desirous that all should
enjoy peace and quiet. He brought an excellent household, who afterward
proved of great honor to the community of Manila. Among the more
illustrious were his nephew Don Alonso de Le&oacute;n, who was an
excellent citizen; Don Tom&aacute;s de Endaya, a native of San
Sebasti&aacute;n, who was thrice commander of the ships on the Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a line, and afterward master-of-camp for his Majesty in
these islands for many years, until the year 1715, when he died; Don
Jos&eacute; de Medraza, native of &Eacute;cija, twice commander on the
Nueva-Espa&ntilde;a line, and regularly-appointed castellan of the fort
of Santiago in the city of Manila, Sargento-mayor Don Jos&eacute; de
Castellar, native of Valladolid, his secretary; Captain Don Juan de
Cabrera; Don Agust&iacute;n Crespo; and many others. In his company
came Don Laureano de Vera, factor, and Don Antonio de Egea, accountant,
of the royal <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>treasury, able ministers, and zealous for the
king&rsquo;s service. The governor made his way through the provinces
of Camarines, Tayabas, and Laguna de Bay, and entered Manila to assume
his office on September 8, the day consecrated to the nativity of our
Lady the most holy Virgin, the mother of God.</p>
<p class="par">In the company of that governor came the largest
re&euml;nforcement that had thus far arrived&mdash;namely, thirty-two
religious, whom the father-procurator, commissary, and vicar-general,
Fray Isidro Rodr&iacute;guez, had brought with him. It was the balance
of the mission that he had sent the former year&mdash;which, all told,
reckoning it as one mission, was the most goodly and numerous mission
that had come to this province from its foundation; for it consisted of
forty-eight religious and three lay-brothers. They entered the convent
of Manila on October 4, the day of St. Francis.</p>
<p class="par">As soon as Don Manuel de Le&oacute;n assumed his
government, Auditor Don Juan Manuel de la Pe&ntilde;a Bonifaz appeared
as a refugee at the porter&rsquo;s lodge of our convent of Manila, with
which the suits that were expected were avoided.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e2991src" href="#xd21e2991" name="xd21e2991src">112</a> However,
he was hardly safe here, for a strenuous effort was made to drag him
out of the sanctuary. For that attempt a very criminal opinion was
given by Licentiate Don Manuel Su&aacute;rez de Olivera; but the new
governor, for greater assurance, referred the matter to Doctor
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name=
"pb279">279</a>]</span>Don Francisco de Pizarra y Orellana,
judge-provisor of the vacant see of Manila, and formerly the
consecrated bishop of Nueva Segovia. He and the orders gave their
opinion to the effect that Don Manuel ought not to be taken from the
sanctuary, as his crime was not <i lang="la">lacsae majestatis in primo
capite</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e2998src" href="#xd21e2998" name=
"xd21e2998src">113</a> which Don Manuel Su&aacute;rez imputed to him
for having usurped the government and for the diminution of the royal
treasury. Don Juan Manuel passed considerable time in that retreat,
until Death with his scythe cut the Gordian knot of that litigation.
Some years later, the resolution of the royal Council of the Indias was
received, in which all that Don Juan Manuel had done was annulled, as
also were the concessions and military titles that he had conferred, as
the rules laid down in the famous law <i lang="la">Barbaribus Philippus
II de offic. Praetor</i> had no place. It is said that capital sentence
came for him, but death had executed it. His wife and children were
left very poor; but that has always been experienced with the children
of auditors in these regions. That plague or punishment is seen in the
citizens of Manila, for scarcely can one find a son who attains
pre&euml;minence by inheritance from his parents. In the daughters
alone is that penalty found to be diminished, but it is finally
executed on the grandchildren. The suit between the two auditors was
also decided by the supreme Council of the Indias in favor of Don
Francisco de Coloma, and he accordingly assumed the government at the
first vacancy.</p>
<p class="par">The community of Manila began to breathe under the
peaceable and disinterested government of Don Manuel de Le&oacute;n,
who tried throughout to fulfil his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280"
href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>duty. First he established
order and discipline in the camp of Manila, by abolishing many abuses.
He appointed Don Juan de Robles Cort&eacute;s, a very noble citizen, as
sargento-mayor, and veteran soldiers as captains. He placed the galleon
&ldquo;San Antonio&rdquo; on the stocks, and constructed galleys for
the fleet, as such vessels had been of great service for defense on the
occasions when Manila had been invaded by the Dutch arms.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3010src" href="#xd21e3010" name=
"xd21e3010src">114</a> As commanders of the galleys he appointed Pedro
Lozano and Don Jos&eacute; de Novoa, a valiant Galician. The latter
went out the second time to pursue the hostile Camucones, in company
with the valiant mulatto Simon de Torres, whose color alone prevented
him from being the commander of the galleys. But those Camucones, as
thievish enemies, carry out their enterprises in safety, and trust
their retreat to the swiftness of their craft, which is remarkable. The
governor ordered Don Pedro de la Pe&ntilde;a to withdraw from the
presidio of Orori on the frontier of the Igolotes, as that presidio was
entirely useless and only an object of expense, without any profit. For
the Igolotes, who are today friendly and subject, rebel tomorrow, and
their villages disappear; and we controlled a few only, who were
gathered in the villages of Bauang, Bangar, and Narbac&aacute;n, where
many souls of those who were baptized were obtained.</p>
<p class="par">That year a function was solemnized which had
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281" href="#pb281" name=
"pb281">281</a>]</span>not been performed for many years, namely, the
publication of the edicts of the Holy Office of the Inquisition in the
cathedral of Manila, on the first Sunday in Lent. The father
commissary, Fray Jos&eacute; de Paternina, was present, as were also
all the officials and servants of the Holy Office, who were but few in
that time. The new governor and the royal Audiencia were present, and
father master Juan de Paz preached. On the following Sunday the letter
of excommunication [<i>anatema</i>] was read, in the form usual to this
holy tribunal, against those who have not denounced within the term of
one week those who had committed the crimes against our holy faith
which are mentioned in the edicts. That solemn function was not again
repeated every three years, as is ordered by the Inquisitors; this was
not done, not only within three years, but not for forty-nine, and
until the present year of 1718, in which this history is
written&mdash;the commissary being the reverend master and father
presentado, Fray Juan de Arichedera, of the Order of Preachers; and the
governor, the mariscal of the army, Don Fernando Manuel Bustillo
Bustamente y Rueda, in his first year. That religious ceremony was
performed with the greatest solemnity that has been seen in these
islands by the many ministers, commissaries, and calificadors,
belonging to the secular clergy and orders, whom the holy tribunal had.
The most eminent persons in the community acted as familiars; at the
order of the Inquisitors of M&eacute;jico, these were present not only
with banners, but also with the white and black cross (the insignia of
this holy office) on their capes and mantles&mdash;the religious
wearing it on their cowls, worked in gold and silver. On the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282" name=
"pb282">282</a>]</span>evening of Saturday, March 12, the procession
marched through all the city, the standard of the faith setting out
from the convent of St. Dominic, carried by Sargento-mayor Don Domingo
Berm&uacute;dez, a citizen of Manila, who had been alcalde-in-ordinary
the preceding year. The regidors and most eminent citizens accompanied
him, dressed in gala attire and on gaily decked horses, and followed by
many lackeys wearing rich livery (which is less costly in Manila than
in other places). The father commissary rode a mule with trappings, and
was accompanied by the servants of the holy tribunal, both
ecclesiastical and lay, the alcaldes with their maces, and the drums,
and followed by the other officials, all on horseback.</p>
<p class="par">The second Sunday of Lent, March 13, the same parade was
held from the convent of St. Dominic to the cathedral. The father
commissary was there, under a canopy in the chancel on the gospel side;
and the ministers of the Holy Office in the body of the church, on
their benches on the epistle side. The above-mentioned governor was
there, and was the head of the city, as there was no royal Audiencia.
The father secretary, Fray Francisco de Contreras, read the edicts, and
the father lecturer Varela, of the Order of St. Dominic, preached.
After mass the standard of the faith was returned, and the father
commissary and all the tribunal went to the convent of St. Dominic,
accompanied by the governor and captain-general, and by the rest of his
retinue of the preceding day.</p>
<p class="par">The following Sunday, March 20, the father commissary
and all the tribunal left the convent of St. Dominic, and went afoot to
the cathedral, where the serious and fearful ceremony was performed of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name=
"pb283">283</a>]</span>reading the letter of excommunication against
those who do not denounce persons whom they know to have fallen into
heresies and the sins mentioned in the edicts. That is a ceremony that
strikes fear and terror into the hardest heart; its tenor and details I
omit, as it is long to tell and terrifying to hear. That ceremony was
performed with the greatest solemnity and gravity possible. Inasmuch as
it is not my intention, nor ought I, to come down to these present
times with my records [in this history], I have thought it advisable to
mention that matter in this place as a memorial of so holy a
ceremony.</p>
<p class="par">Our province was greatly advanced in that triennium by
the great prudence and affability of its provincial, our father Fray
Dionisio Su&aacute;rez, who was more angel than man. With the abundant
aid that had arrived in that year and the preceding one, plenty of
ministers were appointed for all the convents; those convents which had
been united with others were separated, and ministers placed in them;
and in the large and populous places two [ministers were stationed].
The work was so apportioned that it could be endured; for the overwork
occasioned by the lack [of ministers] had been the cause of many dying
and others falling ill. Divine Providence also assisted by
communicating grace to the newcomers, and facility in learning the
languages of our provinces. Therefore, after a few months many of the
latter found themselves sufficiently qualified in that respect to
become ministers, alone and without company, in the missions. This
province became renewed and flourishing with the abundance of
religious, and the study of the arts and theology was greatly assisted
in the convent of Manila. Ministers <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb284" href="#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>were placed in the
missions of those who were recently converted in the hill-country of
Ilocos, in the villages of Acl&aacute;n, Vera, and Bangbanglo, father
Fray Benito de Mena assisting them all the days of his life&mdash;which
lasted until the year 1695, after he had founded the mission called
Bangi, on the outskirts of the province of Cagay&aacute;n. <span class=

was about to be buried alive by his mother as she was impeded in her
flight by reason of her child. This Negrito, being taken to Manila, was
adopted by an American and baptized Pedrito. In due time the young
savage was taken to Europe and America by his adopted father, and
learned to speak Spanish, French, and English, returning after two
years of travel. About two years after his return, Pedrito disappeared,
and joined his own wandering tribesmen. He was seen later by a Prussian
naturalist, a relative of the famous Humboldt, who ascended the
mountain of Mariv&eacute;lez, and who talked with the
&ldquo;reclaimed&rdquo; Negrito. This occurred in 1860.&nbsp;<a class=

galleon landed on the Cagay&aacute;n coast, and it became necessary for
him and his retinue and soldiers to make the overland trip to Manila,
carrying thither the money and treasure that he had brought. The trip
was long, wearisome, and dangerous; Mansilla pushed ahead by other
routes to reach Manila first, and had his priority officially recorded
at once. Moreover, Mansilla bought up warrants for arrearages of pay
due the soldiers, and turned in these for his <i lang="es">media
anata</i> (see <span class="sc">VOL. XXIV</span>, p. 307) to the royal
treasury; &ldquo;and with less than 300 pesos he made good his entire
media anata, each third of which [alluding to the payment of the
year&rsquo;s salary in three instalments] amounted to 909 pesos 7
tomins.&rdquo; But the governor learning of this, obliged him to make

Numerous currents are set up, through the passage among the islands, by
the great equatorial current which crosses the Pacific from east to
west, dividing east of the Philippines. Surface drifts are also set in
motion by the southwest wind in summer and fall, which make the
currents in various directions among the islands at certain times of
the year. These small currents have much influence on the climate,
those in the San Bernardino Strait affecting the peninsula of
Sorsog&oacute;n and the north coast of Samar. Tides in the Philippines
are exceedingly irregular, varying greatly in different places, owing
to the directions in which tidal waves move, and differing also greatly
at different times of the month. See <i>Census of Philippine

Salcedo&rsquo;s enemies concocted the scheme of imprisoning him,
&ldquo;on the pretext of his arrest being made by the Inquisition, and
on a complaint [of his acting] contrary to the Christian faith,&rdquo;
as this would silence all opposition or any attempt to rescue him. They
gained over the master-of-camp, Zepeda, who on the appointed night
stationed his nephew&rsquo;s company on guard at the palace, to which
he himself repaired&mdash;allowing the conspirators to reach the
governor&rsquo;s room unhindered. Through the friars who were concerned
in the plot, they summoned many of the leading citizens&mdash;under
penalty of excommunication for any one who should reveal the matter, or
fail to be present that night at the Augustinian convent at a set (and
unusual) hour&mdash;to assist the commissary of the Inquisition in the
arrest of a prominent but unnamed personage on charges concerning the
holy faith. In order to give further coloring of reason for this
arrest, they consulted beforehand the auditors Bonifaz and Mansilla,
and the Audiencia fiscal, Doctor Francisco Corbera y
Mejia&mdash;&ldquo;not as officials of the Audiencia, but as

resident in the islands. He is very upright and disinterested, and
shows great prudence and energy in the despatch of all causes and

long study and experience have acquired for him. He is modest and
peaceable in behavior, and thus of easy access to all who go to him. He
gives an ear to their affairs very willingly, and with all justice, for
with his Grace nothing is more esteemed than justice. Consequently, his
able and honest method of procedure in the duties in his charge, and
especially his close attention to the duties of the Audiencia and the
other things in his care, make him beloved by all the community. In the
many commissions that have been charged to him, we have seen him
despatch them with great expedition and maturity of judgment. We have
heard all the above declared by several persons on certain occasions;

THE AUTHOR OF THIS BOOK</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">[Chapter i relates the voyage from Spain to Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, in 1646, the ocean trip to Vera Cruz lasting sixty days.
Thence journeying toward Mexico City (chapter ii), they reached the
Dominican hospice of San Jacinto de Tacuba, outside the city walls. The
last land journey, the one to Acapulco, was undertaken November 3,
1647. In chapter iii Navarrete gives a description of Acapulco. Its
houses are all low, &ldquo;the best ones built of mud, and all thatched
with straw. Notwithstanding, for ours <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb286" href="#pb286" name="pb286">286</a>]</span>they demanded from us
four hundred eight-real pieces. This seems incredible; but for me, who
paid the money, it is more than certain.&rdquo; &ldquo;The port is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>the best and safest in the world, as was daily
asserted by those persons who had seen many other ports. Of all that I
have seen, and those have not been few, there is not one that can equal
it. The fort is excellent, and has a battery of twelve first-class
pieces [<i lang="es">apostolado</i>], so that it is impossible for any
ship to enter the port without being sent to the bottom. The climate is
infernal, in accordance with the name that it bears.&rdquo;<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e3065src" href="#xd21e3065" name="xd21e3065src">2</a>
After much delay a patache was finally secured which was going to carry
the usual supplies to the Philippines, the religious (thirty in number)
embarking April 8, 1648. The usual discomforts of the voyage were
experienced, but the patache at last anchored at Lampon.]</p>
<p class="par">At midnight the vendaval blew violently, and, as it came
from the land, our anchors dragged, and we were driven out to sea. One
would believe that a special providence of God sent that wind in order
to prevent the enemy from entering and seizing everything. Next day the
money was made safe, as were also the goods of his Majesty and those of
private persons; and an attempt was made to hide the patache back of an
islet so that the enemy could not discover it, even though they might
enter the same port. We [religious] set out for Manila, and along the
way heard of the singular joy caused by our unexpected arrival, which
had been hoped for or imagined by no one. That great joy was somewhat
tempered because the enemy quite accidentally discovered the patache,
and hastened against it with men and arms. Our men being poorly
prepared, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>and not in harmony, and the commander being but
a sorry soldier, they burned the patache before they ought to have done
so; and in one half hour his Majesty lost 36,000 pesos, and those in
the patache some credit and reputation.</p>
<p class="par">[8]. We continued on our way for four days, on
foot&mdash;not by the road, for there is none, but over inaccessible
high rocks, crags, and passes. We crossed several rivers by swimming,
and forded others with the water up to our breasts. In the mountains
(which are very high, and covered thickly with trees) we found so many
leeches that we could find no relief or means by which to free
ourselves from them, and there was no one who did not lose blood from
his body. I affirm with all truth that I saw one which was burrowing,
head first, half-way through my shoe, and I cried out to some persons
to look at that prodigy; and in fact they did look at it in surprise at
such a thing. The rain fell in great streams from the sky. At the
coming of night, we halted where it overtook us. The Indians covered
over some rude huts with palm leaves, and there we slept upon the grass
and the ground soaked with water. On the last day we descended a hill
two leguas in length, although some said it was longer. Although it
took us three days to ascend that ridge, we descended it in one. It was
very rough in parts, and the rain came down steadily, so that we
slipped at every step without being able to do anything else. I assert
that I saw some of my associates who sat down and allowed themselves to
be carried, not a small distance, by the currents of the water. And yet
they were so joyful and happy that one cannot easily imagine their
delight. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">9. We reached Apanguiel (where there is a very fine
convent of our father St. Francis) so wet, dirty, tired, and hungry,
that all the welcome that was shown us there was needed in order that
we might remain men visible to human eyes. The reception accorded us
was, I presume, in accordance with the charity of those servants of
God. Next day two fathers came thither from Manila, and we had
thereupon another consolation. Another, the father guardian Fray Lucas
de N. took four of us to his convent. He had a very fine church, and a
good enough house, while the site was the best and pleasantest that
could be thought of or imagined. It is located on a height, and the
whole lake of Bay (which is thirty leguas in circumference) and some
islands in its midst, could be seen from a balcony. Land and mountains
could be seen on all sides, with thickets, palm-groves, banana-groves,
rivers, and creeks, which was wonderfully pleasing to the sight. After
that we visited other convents; and all that we saw was novel and
wonderful to us. We departed for Manila in two boats, and, crossing the
bay, spent the night at Binangoa, where the father guardian, Fray
Francisco N. gave us a fine welcome. Next night, we continued our
voyage to the entrance of the lake, where ten boats from Manila were
awaiting us, which were manned by Chinese, mestizos, and Indians. We
said mass, and, having embarked, descended the river to the festal
accompaniment of fire-crackers, small gongs, and arquebuses. The gongs
of the Chinese were very amusing to us; for, though they were no larger
than a barber&rsquo;s basin, they made as much sound as a large bell.
It is a wonderful instrument. The river is one of the most beautiful in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=
"pb290">290</a>]</span>the world. That of Goa is wider and deeper, but
the former is more adorned with palaces, gardens, villages, and
churches. We entered some palaces which would be a wonder to any
European. We reached the bridge of Manila, which is a famous work. We
saw it filled with people of various nationalities. We entered our
convent amid the pealing of bells, and there we immediately visited the
most sacred and miraculous image of our Lady of the Rosary, the
consolation of all that community, and of all those islands also, in
all extremities and necessities. Its sight alone cheered our souls, and
made us forget all our past hardships. The father provincial conceded
to us, as a great treat and privilege, one week of matins. The fathers
of other missions say that only three days had been set aside for them,
so that the time given to us seemed very liberal. In truth, some
assisted in the choir that same night; but my spirit was not so fervent
that it ventured to so much.</p>

<div class="argument">
<p class="par first"><i>Of my stay in Manila</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">1. Don Diego Faxardo Chacon was governor of the
islands. That gentleman had great gifts for government, for he had a
horror of money and of women. One day father Fray Andres Gomez, a
religious of my order, took him a bit of the <i lang="la">lignum
crucis</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, wood of the cross] set in gold. He valued it
highly, but refused to receive the relic until the gold was taken away.
He was very retiring, and gave ear to no one save Manuel Estacio de
Venegas. The latter grew so haughty by reason of the favoritism
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>and power that he possessed, that he dominated
everything as a despot. He was feared by all people, no less than was
Nero in his time; but well did he rue it afterward. Don Diego Faxardo
had kept Don Sebastian de Corcuera a prisoner already for five years.
Strange reversal of fortune that! Don Sebastian was the most feared,
and the most haughty and absolute governor that has ever been in those
islands. In his time happened that exile of the archbishop which caused
so much comment among all those nations. He undertook the Jolo war, in
which the nobility of Manila were destroyed. The island of Hermosa was
lost by his neglect and carelessness in sending re&euml;nforcements, as
was stated by all people there. He amassed untold wealth. He was sent a
prisoner to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and then to Madrid, where it is said
that he negotiated advantageously. They were expecting in Manila
different news from that which arrived, of the condition of his
affairs. I know well that they have written that he was a very
disinterested man, but the author does not prove the statement further
than by saying so. I read in a document that Don Sebastian de Corcuera
purged himself of that charge by saying that he had amassed his wealth
with the pay given him by his Majesty. But another document presents
the following argument. First, that governors cannot trade and traffic
with the pay given them by his Majesty. Second, that it is impossible
to gain with his pay what he spent in the monstrance which was recently
taken to his Majesty; what was lost in the ship wrecked at the
Ladrones, and what was burned at Acapulco; and the money that he
possessed in Mexico, with the large sums taken from him in Burgos. Nor
can it be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>inferred that he was a good governor, because he
acted as a good Christian after he left the islands. Nor does there
follow any other inconvenience from making known the truth with good
zeal than the fact that those who do not wish to know it are not
pleased to hear it. While Estacio de Venegas was a citizen of Manila,
he was liked by all; but, when he became the favorite, he was hated. It
makes a great difference whether one is in the position or not, in
order that he may govern himself according to his natural disposition.
Don Sebastian was the one who instituted the vandalas (this is a name
given by the natives, and signifies repartimiento), which have
destroyed all the Indians. In order that one may understand what they
are, I will explain them here in a few words. I assume, at the start,
that it is a great piece of ignorance to attribute this repartimiento
to Don Sabiniano Manrique de Lara, or to make him its author. When that
gentleman assumed the government, the Indians must have been paying the
vandalas for fourteen or more years; then how could he have originated
them? For, in the term of that gentleman, Pampanga rose in insurrection
in order not to pay that tax. Someone, or several people, new to the
country, must have invented what was afterward declared with the mouth.
It is true that that insurrection caused Don Sabiniano to give the
Indians a great sum of pesos on account of what was owing to them, as I
was told afterward; but that was to pay [their just due], which has
nothing to do with saying that he invented that imposition. In fine,
after the Indian has paid his tribute, helped in the cutting of wood,
and rendered personal services (which are numerous), levies on the
provinces are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href="#pb293" name=
"pb293">293</a>]</span>made each year. For example, Pampanga is
assessed twenty-four thousand fanegas of rice at the price of two or
two and one-half reals per fanega, as it is for his Majesty; and it is
placed on credit until such time as God pleases.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e3101src" href="#xd21e3101" name="xd21e3101src">3</a> That quota
[of rice] is apportioned among the Indians of that province, and is
collected with great rigor, and with many deceits which the
officials<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3104src" href="#xd21e3104" name=
"xd21e3104src">4</a> who exact it practice. [This levy] costs him to
whom three fanegas are allotted at least one-half fanega more than he
gives in his measure; and him who gives six, one fanega more, and so
on. This is what is called vandala, and this is what they [<i>i.e.</i>,
the Spaniards] have paid for so many years&mdash;whence it follows that
the Indians leave the islands, as I shall relate in another part, and
that they refuse to sow their fields, as I myself have heard. It is an
evident fact that if once in a while that assessment were to be levied
on the account of the tribute, or if they were exempted from personal
services, the Indians would be very happy and satisfied. But how can
this continue all the years? and how can there be money in the treasury
to pay the employees, officials, and leaders, and to meet other
expenses, when there is never any money to pay for what is bought from
the Indians? If the Indians die on account of this and other things, of
what use will that country be, and what will the Spaniards do there?
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href="#pb294" name=
"pb294">294</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">3 [<i>i.e.</i>, 2]. The greatest hardship that we
religious endure in the villages of the Indians is the sight of their
sufferings, and the effort to seek means and methods to console them.
It happens (as it happened in my time) that the rice-crop in a village
was ruined (this is a quite usual occurrence, because of the rats which
eat it, and at other times for the lack of water, and at others because
the sea rises and overflows their fields) so that it was impossible to
pay even the tribute. That was explained to the alcalde-mayor, and a
petition was presented to the governor. But nothing had any effect, and
the Indians had to purchase the rice at four reals per fanega, and gave
it to his Majesty on credit that would never be paid, at two and
one-half reals [per fanega]. Surely, the paternal compassion of our
most Catholic kings would not permit such things if they had any
knowledge of them. It would be better for the Indians that the
governors should support them, and that they should work during the
whole year for the tribute and vandalas, than that they should be
treated as they are today. It is a great misfortune that the Tartar
protects so well the Chinese, his vassals, while our people try to
escape from caring for the vassals of our king and sovereign, although
his will has been so often declared and charged upon them. It is no
wonder that those islands are so exhausted, although it is a land which
in every way is exceedingly good, abundant, and fertile.</p>
<p class="par">[3]. If I were to mention special cases I would never
finish. In my time I know well that an alcalde-mayor of Ilocos squeezed
fourteen thousand pesos from his district in two years. In how good
condition <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>must the Indians and their land have remained!
It would be well for those who write and have written from there to
speak clearly and specifically of things and persons, and not in
general and in loose terms, thus giving opportunity to blame the
innocent or to clear the guilty. That ought to be a special end or
desire. Everyone knows how disinterestedly our province lives and has
lived in that land, and that it has never allowed the slightest income
as dues of the Indians whom it administers. It has never received them,
but has always been satisfied with the alms which both the Spaniards
and the natives of the country freely give. In that way have they
maintained themselves, while with the alms given them by his Majesty
(may God preserve him) they have clothed themselves, and nothing has
been wanting. It is necessary to declare who does it, in order not to
injure all....</p>
<p class="par">4. One year a certain governor wrote against Ours of
Pangasinan (he was at one time affectioned to Ours and at another
averse, for so wags the world) that they had burned some forests whence
wood had to be obtained for the shipbuilding, etc. What effects would
such a letter cause if seen in the Council of the Indias, and one
written by a governor? If one wished to burn the hundredth part of one
single forest with the help of ten thousand Indians, he could not do it
in a whole year; to whomever has seen the forests of Philipinas this
remark is not only true but most true, and the proofs are more than
evident. The effect produced by the Negrillos who live in the interior
of those and other forests, although they are numerous and make fires
daily, is never noticed or heard of. In the island of Mindoro,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name=
"pb296">296</a>]</span>where I made two journeys, I saw with my own
eyes what the Indians do there. They have no lands for sowing. In order
to get rice they set fire to a bit of forest. After days of labor in it
they continue to fell and cut down the small trees together with the
branches; then they again set fire to it and burn it all. They set
fires at the foot of the large trees, until gradually the thick ones
are consumed. As the trees are so hard-wooded, it is necessary to take
a week and even longer to arrange and feed the fire. After an Indian
has worked from morning to night for two months, he manages to clear an
<i lang="es">obrada</i><a class="noteref" id="xd21e3129src" href=
"#xd21e3129" name="xd21e3129src">5</a> of land. Then how could a vicar
and a few Indians burn whole forests? If this were not so, I would not
write it; but, since the case is quite forgotten, I will refrain [from
enlarging on] it&mdash;except that, for others that may happen, it is
advisable to know this one, so that no one may inconsiderately believe
what is in reality incredible. Don Sebastian Cavallero de Medina, while
fiscal for his Majesty in Manila, in order to show his zeal or to gain
reputation, wrote about the excessive fees which the religious
collected from the Indians. People here would believe that such an
offense was common to all. He ought to have made known what was in it,
and not place the innocent in danger of being declared guilty by not
explaining the fault of some persons.</p>
<p class="par">5. A week after our arrival we were divided among
various provinces in order to learn the languages, and be able to
minister to the Indians. I remained in the province of Manila, where I
learned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>the Tag&aacute;log language in company with
others without much difficulty. If the grammar or other handbook were
studied in Europa with the earnestness with which we study languages
there, any person would become learned in a very brief time. Within
five months we were all confessing and preaching, and in one year we
were very capable in both, and in discussing the affairs of the Indians
with them. During that time, besides the occupations of the choir and
church, we diverted ourselves with no other thing. All that time we
spent in humbling ourselves to the elements and rudiments of
extraordinary languages, for the maintenance and advantage of those
souls. If the temperature were not so unlike that of our own country,
we could have done twice as much. In order to relieve ourselves from
the excessive heat, we made use of baths and of the fruits, which are
very delicious; but, as time went on, we experienced sickness. The
Indians always seemed fine fellows to me. They are not changeable and
rough like those whom we saw in Mexico, but tractable and urbane and of
especial intelligence and fine ability. Among them are some famous
writers, painters, and sculptors. They are very adaptable for any
mechanical work, and, above all, docile and very submissive to the
priests. In regard to understanding the precepts of our holy faith,
they can rival many here and surpass others. They possess fine books in
their language, which have been printed by the religious. They are fond
of reading in these, and to our labor and their docility is this fact
owing. The Indian women are very devout and composed, and frequent the
sacraments with great fervor. There is no feast, great or small, at
which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>there are not a large number of confessions and
communions. I said often that the fervor of the old [Christians] of
Castilla had passed to the Indians (both men and women) of Manila.</p>
<p class="par">Often the Indians celebrate the feasts well. Rarely is
one of them found who does not dance beautifully. Consequently, they
have dancing and music in the processions; they play the harp and
guitar excellently. His Majesty furnishes eight singers in every
church. They have certain privileges, as they are busied in the divine
office. They sing excellently, and, as there are always candidates, the
number is always in excess. But only the eight who are assigned enjoy
the privileges conceded. The adornment of the churches is quite
sufficient, and is neat and tasteful. Since there are plenty of roses,
other flowers, and fragrant herbs throughout the year, these things go
far to furnish suitable adornment for the churches.</p>
<p class="par">6. The Indians are much given to the use of the bow and
arrow, especially the Indians called Cambales and those who live in the
mountains. Their offensive and defensive weapons consist of such arms.
I heard the old priests tell of many acts of skill in the use of them,
which I was unable to believe until I had the opportunity to see it
thoroughly for myself. People should not be so ready to believe
whatever they hear, nor yet so obstinate as I have been at times. One
day I came across a band of Indians from the mountain, among whom were
four of seven or eight years of age or thereabout. I took an orange (a
fruit of which there is an infinite supply there) and threw it up into
the air as high as possible. Then said I, &ldquo;There, my lads, shoot
me that orange.&rdquo; Instantly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299"
href="#pb299" name="pb299">299</a>]</span>all four shot it in the air,
and it fell in bits. Another new religious and myself stood stupefied,
while the old one who had told us about it laughed at us. I saw that
with my own eyes in the small village called Abucanamataas. This is a
sufficient proof that they are good archers.</p>
<p class="par">7. During my stay in the islands, I attended to whatever
obedience ordered me. I ministered to the Indians, lectured in our
college and university of Santo Thomas, and preached&mdash;although I
was always in poor health, for during two years the [climate of the]
country affected me terribly. During that time some remarkable things
happened; but I shall relate only a few of them, in order not to be too
prolix. The master-of-camp, Don Loren&ccedil;o Laso&mdash;a fine and
valiant soldier, and a giant in presence and stature&mdash;was governor
of Terrenate. He was not liked by Manuel Estacio. He was accused of
some traffic with the Dutch (pure nonsense that); his arrest was
ordered, and he died on shipboard somewhat suddenly. His death was
imputed to Estacio, and the latter was charged with it; I do not know
how he cleared himself. Don Loren&ccedil;o&rsquo;s death was felt
keenly, and was suspicious. He was well liked by all the community, and
so feared and respected by the Chinese infidels that he alone, with
sword and shield, in the insurrection that occurred during the term of
Corcuera, held back a mob of Chinese on the bridge, who were entering
by that way, as did Horatius Cocles on a similar occasion. Admiral
Sebastian Lopez, a Portuguese and a most brave soldier, was living in
Manila; he had performed wonders in the victories that we gained over
the Dutch. He died very suddenly, and apparently by poison. His
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span>death was also imputed to Manuel Estacio, as
were many other deeds that were current here.</p>
<p class="par">8. As the Dutch had committed depredations in that land
in preceding years, and raided the districts of Batan (which are
administered by religious of my order), and, because of our lack rather
than their own valor, had taken possession of the churches, the
government determined to demolish these. The principal mistake
consisted in having allowed [the destruction of] those buildings
already erected and finished; for they could be of no use to the enemy,
since they had no seaport nor anchorage for their ships within one
legua, nor yet a safe way by land if they had tried to journey that
way. Our cowardice allowed the enemy to enter, and determined the ruin
of those buildings, in which the natives suffered great hardship; for
not only did they work, but all the timber (which was considerable,
excellent, and their own) was taken from them, without giving them a
single maravedi for it. Even of the stone Manuel Estacio made gifts. If
the materials, since they were theirs, had been left to the Indians, so
that they could have made use of them, they could have destroyed the
churches and had more than enough money and time for their sowing and
ordinary work. Many hardships came upon the poor wretches because of
that; the least was that the enemy took some of them captives, as well
as two of our religious, who were able ministers in the Tag&aacute;log
speech.</p>
<p class="par">When Don Loren&ccedil;o Laso died, Don Lorenco de Ayala
became master-of-camp. He had been castellan of the fort of Santiago.
He was a very amiable gentleman, and there was no one in Manila who did
not love him dearly. Do&ntilde;a Ana Tellez, his wife, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name="pb301">301</a>]</span>was
a saintly woman; and the couple were known as &ldquo;the good married
pair.&rdquo; Each of them was more than seventy years old. Estacio was
not satisfied at that, for the proud fellow could not endure to have
anyone ascend higher than himself. He heaped troubles upon Don
Loren&ccedil;o and the good old man ended his days to the general
sorrow of all who knew him. The staff of office then passed to Don
Pedro de Almonte. For some time past that gentleman had been exiled
from Manila; he was not of Estacio&rsquo;s following, and consequently,
it was feared that he would be cheated out of the office. But since the
governor already had his eyes on Estacio because the latter had done a
bad turn to Don Juan de Saraos, he summoned Don Pedro and gave him the
command, as well as the habit of Santiago which went with it. The
community was overjoyed at that, while Estacio was very sorrowful, and
somewhat anxious about his fortune; for since he had been so exalted,
and that with no small acts of violence, he could fear that a fall
would follow his steps.... On the day of the Holy Cross in September, a
quiet rumor spread through the city that he was arrested. All the
people kept mute and did not dare to move their lips; for, if it were
not true, he who uttered a single word would pay well for it. The news
was confirmed, and it was ascertained that he had been imprisoned in
the fort of Santiago. The city breathed and was relieved from so heavy
a cross that had rested on it for so many years. He commenced on that
day to take what God sent him; <i lang="la">cum in honore esset non
intellexit</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3161src" href="#xd21e3161"
name="xd21e3161src">6</a> He did not understand or know <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>how
to retain his power.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e3169src" href=
"#xd21e3169" name="xd21e3169src">7</a> Much of his property was seized,
but he had hidden a vast quantity both in Manila and in Mexico. He
suffered and endured, and finally died, after some years, in a dungeon.
He would better have contented himself with his first fortune as
merchant and citizen of Manila, in which every one liked him. He is the
man who said he could stop the mouth of any governor who might succeed
Don Diego with one or two hundred thousand pesos of eight. He deceived
himself basely.</p>
<p class="par">10. On Corpus Christi day of 53, a not small disaster
happened to me, namely, that a bolt of lightning fell on the house of
Batan, where I was then stationed. The Lord saved me and the other
religious and the men of the convent. One week later another fell and
fired off two muskets belonging to the house, killing a negro and an
Indian who had gone out hunting. That disaster caused me a great fear;
until then I confess that I had had little or no fear of thunder, but
since then I have feared it so much that I could not fear it more. A
little while after that, on the eve of St. Barnabas, when we were
taking our collegiates of Santo Thomas to their vacations, as we were
crossing the river the wind blew with great violence, so that the boat
overturned and we all fell into the water. The waves were running so
high that, as we firmly grasped the planks of the small champan, for it
was overturned, it dragged us forward as if we were chaff. Our danger
was great; and accordingly I was careful to absolve all, although with
great hardship and tribulation. I had no one to absolve me, and almost
no feeling or warning to lift <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303"
href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>my heart to God. The people
who were looking at us, without being able to help us, were
innumerable. It was God&rsquo;s pleasure that they should launch some
canoes; and, although these were also overturned, they saved us. I was
in the greatest danger, because of the weight of my habit. Two negroes
who came up to me were they who, next to God, saved my life. We all
returned to the wharf; our clothing and other things were lost. But the
flask of wine for the mass, with only a little of its contents lost,
was washed ashore, where it was recovered. Our Lord was pleased to
deliver me, by His mercy, from all those accidents.</p>
<p class="par">11. At that time word reached us of a grievous
misfortune which had happened in Cagayan to one of my mission named
Fray Luis Gutierrez, a native of Almagro, and a most excellent
religious. On the day of the purification of our Lady in that year, he
had said two masses in different villages. There was another village
three leguas away. For the consolation of those Indians, and so that
they might not be left without the mass on so solemn a day, he
determined to go thither to say the third, and went by boat through a
creek, which was most dangerous because of the crocodiles. In a certain
place it was seen that one appeared disturbed. The Indians of the boat
aroused themselves and tried to force the craft forward and to make a
loud noise with voices and oars. But nothing availed them, for with two
cruel blows of its tail against the boat the crocodile overturned it
completely, so that they were all thrown into the water. The Indians,
being lighter and unhampered by clothing, were able to reach land
easily. The poor religious, weighted down by his habit and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>little used to swimming, was left to be
overtaken by that fierce and bloodthirsty animal. It seized him, and
the poor man was buried in its fierce entrails....</p>
<p class="par">13. At times I saw most cruel and terrifying
crocodiles&mdash;especially one morning when, going down to say mass at
a village, I was descending the river to the sea. The Indians began to
cry out &ldquo;Crocodile, crocodile!&rdquo; I looked about me in every
direction, but could see none. They pointed it out to me with the
finger, but even then I could not be sure that it was one. It was a
fact that I did really see it, but, since it was so large and horrible,
I could not persuade myself that it was a crocodile, or that there was
so large a crocodile in the world as the mass that they pointed out to
me. We approached nearer, and I finally saw and distinguished it most
clearly. It was sleeping on a sandy islet near the mouth of the river.
It seemed to be as large as the mainmast of a ship, and I had before
imagined that mass to be some huge tree carried there by the current of
that great river. I saw others afterward, although they were not equal
to that one in size. Their aspect is most horrible, for they have four
eyes, two above and two below. There are a countless number of them in
the lake of Bai. During the dry season the larger cattle are pastured
near there, for that place abounds in fine pastures. When the bulls and
horses are feeding, and as they wander about in their grazing, the
crocodile comes out of the water and carries off one today and another
tomorrow with as great ease as the cat carries off a rat.</p>
<p class="par">14. A short time before my arrival in the islands, a
very peculiar thing happened. Some Indians had <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span>been
married, and, as they were about to eat, the bride was desirous of
going down to the river to wash her feet, as they are in the habit of
doing every day and every hour. The house stood partly over the river,
as is their custom. While she was washing, a crocodile attacked her and
carried her off. At her cries and the noise, some of the people ran out
and saw the poor girl in the teeth of the crocodile, which was making
off with its prey. The bridegroom, who beheld with his own eyes such a
spectacle, blind with love and aroused by anger, with dagger in hand
(but more rashly than prudently) threw himself into the water, and
followed the beast that was carrying off his beloved prize. He overtook
it and fought with it; he recovered his wife and returned triumphantly
with the spoil in his arms, but she was already dead and lifeless. The
bridegroom came back a widower, and sad and mournful, and with tears
was that wedding ended. That was a notable and very memorable
occurrence. Many Indians have escaped from those monsters. It has been
learned by experience that they are very sensitive in the eyes.
Consequently, those who do not lose their presence of mind attack them
in that part, on which occasions the crocodile flees as best it can in
order to escape. It is said by all the people of that land that when
the female lays its eggs, it always goes to some place where there is a
current of water near by. The young animals having been hatched go down
into the water, where their mother is waiting for them with open mouth.
As many as she can catch she eats, but all that escape her, by one side
or the other, remain free and alive. This they say is the reason why
not all the rivers are full of those animals, although <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb306" href="#pb306" name=
"pb306">306</a>]</span>there are many rivers where they abound. I shall
return to the crocodiles on another occasion.</p>

translation of the title-page of this book is as follows:
&ldquo;Historical, political, ethical, and religious treatises on the
monarchy of China. A brief description of that empire and curious
instances regarding the emperors and magistrates of that country.
Accompanied by a diffuse narrative of various events and singular
things in other kingdoms, and various voyages. The pontifical decrees
and propositions authorized in Roma for the Chinese mission are added,
and a bull of our most holy father Clemente X, in favor of the
missionaries. By the father master Fray Domingo Fernandez Navarrete,
professor of morning classes in the college and university of Santo
Thom&agrave;s of Manila, apostolic missionary in Great China, superior
of those of his mission, and procurator-general in the court of Madrid
for the province of Santo Rosario of Filipinas, of the Order of
Preachers. He dedicates his work to the most serene Don Juan of
Austria. Year 1676. With license. Madrid, in the royal printing-house.
Printed by Juan Garcia Infan&ccedil;on. At the expense of Florian
Anisson, bookseller.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par footnote">Domingo Fernandez Navarrete, a native of
Pe&ntilde;afiel in the province of Valladolid and diocese of Palencia,
and a son of the convent at the same place (December 8, 1635), after
having studied in the college at Valladolid became lecturer on
philosophy in the same institution. On arriving at the Philippines he
was first assigned to the Tag&aacute;log missions, and immediately
appointed lecturer in theology in the college of Santo Tom&aacute;s of
Manila; but he was sent to the province of Bataan because of his poor
health. Soon, however, his superiors were compelled to reappoint him to
the chair in the college, for the same reason. Taking advantage of the
summer vacation, the zealous father went to the Mindoro missions, where
he labored and suffered considerably; and in 1653 he went to Macasar,
whence he had to return without accomplishing anything. His ill health
continuing, he was forced to try to return to his convent in Spain. He
was detained for some time in Macasar, and there, fearing the long
journey ahead of him, determined to go to China by way of
Macao&mdash;reaching the city of Fogan November 3, 1658, after many
sufferings. Applying himself to the study of the Chinese language, he
mastered it in both the written and spoken forms. Although he could
have escaped at the outbreak of the persecution of Christians in 1664,
he refused to do so, and was arrested in February, 1665. July 8 of that
year he was taken to Peking with other Dominicans. Being condemned to
exile, he left Peking, September 13, 1665, and remained in Canton until
1669, when he secretly set out for Manila. On reaching Macao, he
determined to return to Europe instead of to Manila, finally arriving
at Lisbon in 1672. He reached Madrid in May of that year, and Rome (his
objective point) on January 6, 1673. After his return to Madrid (within
sixteen months), he exercised the duties of procurator-general for the
Philippine province. In 1677 he was appointed bishop of Isla
Espa&ntilde;ola, where he arrived in 1678. He died in 1689, aged over
seventy. He wrote three volumes of his voyages, but only two of them
were printed; these appeared in several languages. He also wrote
various things in the Chinese language. See <i lang="es">Rese&ntilde;a
